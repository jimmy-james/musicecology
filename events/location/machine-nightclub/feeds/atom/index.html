&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spektre v2.1 at Precinct was so much fun, we're gonna call it home, but first they have to renovate, so we'll be back there in March.

&lt;p&gt;We've partied like there's no tomorrow and then we partied some more. Over the past year it has been an honor and a privilege to share our creative ideas with you. We've partied with the likes of Photek, Moldy, Space Jesus, Wheez-ie and many more. As we celebrate our 1 year anniversary we also say good bye to our residency at Machine. Boy, we've had some good times didn't we?&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We are putting the band back together one last time to commemorate this special occasion. This night will bring you visual antics of VJ Adrenochrome, deco by Kate Van Rees and the return of our very first headliner KING all the way from Las Vegas. Here are some photos from some of our nights nights over the past year. Let's make the last party even more memorable!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.321554474545832.82632.205784452789502&amp;amp;type=3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.321554474545832.82632.205784452789502&amp;amp;type=3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.342278222473457.86715.205784452789502&amp;amp;type=3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.342278222473457.86715.205784452789502&amp;amp;type=3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2646251435675.2119881.1237320039&amp;amp;type=3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.2646251435675.2119881.1237320039&amp;amp;type=3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.3148968883297.2130672.1237320039&amp;amp;type=3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;http://www.facebook.com/media/set/?set=a.3148968883297.2130672.1237320039&amp;amp;type=3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Musical guests:&lt;br /&gt;KING (Slit Jockey/119 Sound) - Las Vegas&lt;br /&gt;John Barera (Mmmmaven) - Boston&lt;br /&gt;Jonathan Santarelli (Unregular Radio) - Boston&lt;br /&gt;Sean Caron (Machine) - Boston&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;King&lt;br /&gt;Long time bass music royalty, KING started his musical career as a DJ.

&lt;p&gt;Bass Glutton (&lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/bass-glutton" rel="nofollow nofollow" target="_blank"&gt;http://soundcloud.com/bass-glutton&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Producer Nick Smeed wanted to take his music back to where he started before the aggressive styles of his more commonly know identity of L.E.D.FUT took over. Even as L.E.D.FUT Nick always expressed his versatility through his production showing that he could dabble in just about any genre and do it well. If you know Nick one thing that he has always expressed was that he had a real sweet spot when&lt;br /&gt;it came to deep, sexy, bassy music with a hiphop influence.&amp;nbsp;Starting out as a hiphop/Rnb producer this came as no surprise. Bass Glutton is essentially electronic music made for people who love to overindulge in those sensual, soulful, intelligent, in your face bassy beats and grooves. Bass Glutton intends to elaborate on the current styles in this realm of electronic music and also pepper in some of the classic styles we have all come to love over the years.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;Nite Krawla&lt;br /&gt;+&lt;br /&gt;Genesis Residents&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;10 PM - 2 AM, 21+, $10 - includes admission to Factory in the lounge&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

Our musical guests this month are Wheez-ie and Doctor Jeep.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wheez-ie&lt;br /&gt;Wheez-ie is a 23 year-old producer/DJ from Houston who specializes in the dancefloor-shaking madness that is bass music. He has already released two EPs this year: the Juke-infused All Worked Up EP on Well Rounded Individuals, and the XLR8R-lauded Keep Yer Chin Up EP for Embassy Recordings, which has been called "pristine and full" "clean and smooth," and, at the same time, "spastic."&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;His releases have appeared on the aforementioned Well Rounded Individuals and Embassy Recordings as well as Salva's infamous Frite Nite label, while his remixes of Distal's "Coke Bottle" and Zoltan's "Pawnoramics" appeared on Grizzly and Freshmore, respectively. He's had support from DJs all around the world, including Machinedrum, Salva, Distal, DJ Rashad, Sines, J da Flex, Canblaster, Sam Tiba Ana Sia, Dubbel Dutch, Nasty Nasty, Dave Q, Donga, Damu Kanji Kinetic, Cedaa, Jackmaster, Cardopusher, Sinden and Mele. As he expands his career and continues releasing music, his entourage of admirers, friends and co-conspirators is only going to expand along with it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/wheez-ie"&gt;http://soundcloud.com/wheez-ie&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.facebook.com/WheezieDubz"&gt;http://www.facebook.com/WheezieDubz&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Doctor Jeep&lt;br /&gt;Doctor Jeep is a 21-year old New York native known to most as Andre Lira. As a founder of Boston's Banana Peel crew, he's quickly gaining notoriety as one of the city's most diverse young selectors, blending upbeat house and techno with the global sounds of baile funk, dancehall, old-school uk garage, african percussionism and more. With eclectic DJ sets mixing the past, present, and future of dance music in some of Boston's best clubs, he has proven to adapt to any vibe and make it his own style of party.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Production-wise, Jeep's music has been described as "a style somewhere between the tropical inclinations of Dutty Artz and the grinding 808 electro of Swamp81." He's released two EP's this year on his own imprint and growing New York label End Fence.

Recordings, Sounds of Sumo, Hot N Heavy, Brap Dem, Betamorph and Phantom Hertz, Dash has showed his versatility in genres with tunes ranging from dubstep, jungle, drum and bass, house, garage and UK funky. The eclecticism of his rhythms lends to a frenzy on the dancefloor, and has bought him continued support and play from leading DJ's, producers and labels worldwide, as well as radio play on BBC Radio 1. This is what Juno downloads had to say about his most recent release "Friends":&lt;br /&gt;"Review:&lt;br /&gt;In its original form, "Friends" is a track full of glorious contrasts. At times, it feels like an emotion-rich, melody-heavy tribute to touchy-feely dancefloor classics. At others, it stimulates the hips and feet with bleep-laden rhythms pitched somewhere between tropical, future garage and post-dubstep beats. The deeper, more atmospheric "Nothing" redresses the balance slightly, before "Effed Up" drags us kicking and screaming towards the dancefloor with some particularly pulsating garage grooves. Of the six accompanying remixes, it's the unashamedly positive vibes of Daniel Klauser that really hits the spot - though Sleverance's retro-futurist rave-up is also worth a listen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;-Support from: Doorly, Starkey, Malente &amp;amp; Detboi "&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DJ Zola&lt;br /&gt;Zola is Charles Mazzola, a writer, inciter, and Resident DJ of the LiS/Use Your Head home party crew. He was captured by the Electronic Dance Music scene and while traveling abroad for several months, his heart stayed in IBIZA. Alas, he is a lover of all forms of music, especially the eclectic. Living, working, and attending as many shows as possible-spreading the word of amazing and underground music. Charles regularly plays established nights around Boston, NY and RI and with touring bands.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As always creative attire is encouraged!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We hope to see you on Saturday, March 3rd at &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Machine Nightclub (Fenway)&lt;br /&gt;1254 Boylston Street in Boston&lt;br /&gt;"Fenway" or "Kenmore" stops on the Green Line&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;10 PM - 2 AM, 21+, $10 - includes admission to Factory with DJ Static and Volvox (&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/380789775269099/"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/events/380789775269099/&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've partied like there is no tomorrow. We prepared for all the carnage of the apocalypse. Instead we got a second chance. A chance to create a new world, to raise our faces to the sun, to breathe this new air, to reach out to our fellow human, animal or machine... A chance to finally embrace our differences and build a world unlike any other. We invite you to Genesis. Witness the beginning...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We welcome you to the third installment of Genesis - a unique party brought to you by Music Ecology, Kate Van Rees and VJ Adrenochrome. We have prepared a whole new batch of awesome music, deco and visuals for an ultimate party experience.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We've covered plant and water at our previous two events so the time has come to first meet the inhabitants of this new world. This Saturday prepare for the first contact between two cultures previously unaware of each other - ours and theirs.

A "veteran of American dubstep" (flavorwire.com, 4/19/10) and "New York City dubstep pioneer" (thekronicle.com, 3/3/10), Moldy has been "quietly leading the charge of US dubstep producers since day one" (dubwarnyc.com, 5/29/10).&lt;strong id="internal-source-marker_0.5071998536586761"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://selectormoldy.com/"&gt;http://selectormoldy.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/moldyselector"&gt;https://www.facebook.com/moldyselector&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;DJ Codiac&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;The one like Codiac is embedded deep in the Boston underground bass music scene. Currently he is the Director of Business Development for the Together Festival and also helps run the SUBduction Productions events and promo camp.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We'll introduce some basic oceanic life forms and plants&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SPACE JESUS&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Philly based EDM producer Jasha Tull has created an ever expanding and mind melting experience as Space Jesus. Exploring a multitude of EDM stylings and effectively branding each track with his own bass fueled, psychedelic, Hip-Hop flavor, Space Jesus delivers music that is undeniably fresh and consistently captivating. Jasha began producing music at age 16 with an initial focus on Hip-Hop, that eventually led to his fascination with the production of future-bass music. In 2011, Jasha released SPACE JESUS EP, which immediately brought him an incredible amount of followers throughout the East Coast. Quickly gaining recognition for his individuality, creativity, and high-energy live show, Space Jesus has been popping up all over the states, sharing the stage with incredible acts such as Conspirator, Two Fresh, Minnesota, The Polish Ambassador and Bluetech. Space Jesus has instantly become a mainstay of the electronic music festival scene, with appearances at The Magnetic Gathering and The Big Up in 2011. Hustlin' hard into the new year, Space Jesus shown no signs of slowing down. Keep your eyes peeled, or keep 'em shut, either way you're bound to see Space Jesus tear a wormhole right through the 2012 festival season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've partied like there is no tomorrow. We prepared for all the carnage of the apocalypse. Instead we got a second chance. A chance to create a new world, to raise our faces to the sun, to breathe this new air, to reach out to our fellow human, animal or machine... A chance to finally embrace our differences and build a world unlike any other. We invite you to Genesis. Witness the beginning...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The creators of Music Ecology are uniting with VJ Adrenochrome, Kate Van Rees and the team at Machine Nightclub to bring you a new monthly weekend event called Genesis. We invite you to explore the possibilities of a new world with us. Each installment of Genesis will unveil a new visible feature of this world and for the first one we'd like to focus on&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;FLORA&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We'll explore everything that has to do with vegetation, plants, trees, vines, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your participation and creative attire are welcome and encouraged!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In the beginning there was BASS... so your aural senses will be entertained by&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;King (119, Shift Recordings, Play Me Records, SMASH!) - Las Vegas&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Long time bass music royalty, KING started his musical career as a DJ. Cutting his teeth in the Las Vegas Rave and Drum &amp;amp; Bass scene starting back in &amp;lsquo;97. Pushing forward since with multiple acclaimed mixtapes and CD&amp;rsquo;s. Since then, he has finely tuned his ear and moved on to producing &amp;amp; DJ&amp;rsquo;ing other tempos, including dubstep, glitch, tropical inspired four-four bass music, all the way up to 160BPM footwork &amp;amp; juke. One not to be held down with constraints of time signature or tempo, blending influences of Garage, House, Dubstep, Soul, Funk and Tropical, into smooth, extremely bass-heavy music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With releases on Play Me, 119, Shift, Betamorph, and Tuff Love Dubs, KING has steadily worked his way to the top! With recent weekly airplay on BBC Radio 1xtra with high acclaim from Mista Jam&amp;rsquo;s Daily Dose of Dubstep.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KING&amp;rsquo;s future projects look just exciting as his past, with forthcoming releases on Starkey&amp;rsquo;s Seclusiasis Imprint, his &amp;ldquo;Bad Dudes&amp;rdquo; collaboration with Air Stegosaurus, and a slew collaborations with countless vocalists and musicians.&lt;/p&gt;
