These cats have been  tearing up down in Boston, and here's your chance to catch them in New  Hampshire. Music Ecology is a weekly gathering of producers, DJs,  musicians and artists focused on exposing live, original, and fresh  electronic music and local art. The night is held every Tuesday at Wonder Bar in Allston. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Professorpious&lt;/strong&gt; -(glitch.fm, Music Ecology)  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href="http://soundcloud.com/professorpious" target="_blank"&gt;http://soundcloud.com/professorpious&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt; Professorpious has been hooked on electronic music since the late  nineties where he was drawn to the frenetic sounds of DnB as a young  man. He bought some turntables found a warehouse and threw his first  parties in late 2000. A brief trip to London in 2001 and a visit to  Fabric nightclub provided the catalyst to switch styles from DnB to  Breaks. Then in 2005 Pious attended Burning Man and heard Dubstep and  Glitch Hop for the first time and instantly knew this was the sound of  the future. Today you can hear anyone or all of these styles in a Pious  set.&lt;br /&gt; Currently Pious holds down residency at Lost In Bass every Monday on glitch.fm as well as at the Tuesday weekly Music Ecology.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ali Berger&lt;/strong&gt; - &lt;a href="http://aliberger.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank"&gt;http://aliberger.bandcamp.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*************3$ 21+, 5$ 18+***********DOORS @ 8****************&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
