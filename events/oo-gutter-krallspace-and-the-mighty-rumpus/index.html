      content='Music Ecology brings you even more fresh EDM! This week from: $0_$0_gutteR (Vermin Street) Krallspace (http://soundcloud.com/krallspace) THE MIGHTY RUMPUS (http://the-mighty-rumpus.com/) $0_$0_gutteR (Vermin Street) One of the founding members of the notorious Boston underground collective Vermin Street, $0_$0_gutteR has the best collection of shit ya never heard. He&#39;s too cool for social networking sites and has no online presence. However, his dj sets bring over-the-top sounds from under-the-radar artists to keep the heads noddin and the butts movin, Nuff said, just be there. Krallspace (http://soundcloud.com/krallspace) That heavy bass sound that sends shivers down your spine and a high voltage jolt through your veins is the sound that Alex Rivera Krall prides himself on. With a vast variety of clashing genres of music and an arsenal of tricks and effects Krallspace vows to wow. A major contributor to the ever-expanding Boston dubstep scene, Krall has been assembling... thrilling glitch, dubstep, and hip-hop oriented tracks that have landed him opportunities to play at several major clubs in Boston (Middle East Downstairs, Brighton Music Hall, Wonderbar etc...) and major northeastern festivals in Camp Bisco IV and Desiderata. Alex has also been able to take the stage alongside several noteworthy acts in Electronic music some of which include but are not limited to Datsik, EOTO, 12th Planet, MiMOSA, Two Fresh, Paper Diamond, Daedelus and Archnemesis while also performing regularly alongisde Boston&#39;s own Terravita (Hot Pink Delorean). Currently residing in Allston Massachusetts, Krallspace has been hard at work on his debut EP "Playing With Fire" that he will deliver to the hands of the public as a free download with an expected release in late 2011. frankster and Henny Rock present: THE MIGHTY RUMPUS (http://the-mighty-rumpus.com/) frankster Frank Heiss has been doing the music thing since he started hitting things with drum sticks at the age of 4. After his college band opened for future legends Phish in 1990, a friend played him a hardcore cassette tape mixed by Nicky Black Market and he never looked back - selling his acoustic drums in favor of samplers, sequencers, synthesizers and ultimately an Akai MPC-3000. He immediately saw that embracing technology and becoming one with machines would allow further innovation over imitation. He was inspired by and introduced to the world of electronic dance music in the early 1990&#39;s by none other than Dr. Walker of the German electronic duo Air Liquide after the two were introduced at dawn on Avenue C in New York City Awakening an eternal space brotherhood. His first vinyl EP Radical Technology was released in 1995 on the UK label Rising High courtesy of Casper Pound who rests in Peace at One with The Spirit World. Frank Heiss was further inducted into the global electronic underground as part of the Liquid Sky family by Carlos "Soul" Slinger who helped dub him tube. His innovative work as tube has yielded six albums to date pioneering a sound he calls: Mental Step. The debut tube release Alive was called "sonic sorcery" by CMJ and compared to the likes of Aphex Twin and Squarepusher. Frank Heiss also recorded a multi-genre full length for Harvest/EMI under the name HearNow, and has created a simply absurd Country-Western/Breakbeat crossover project known as The Hick Step Massive. After spending some time focused on producing anonymous music for television and taking a hiatus from performing live, he has once again picked up drum sticks and come full circle as an electronic percussionist. The Mighty Rumpus is frankster&#39;s latest offering as an electronic percussionist, having teamed up with master engineer Henny Rock on baritone guitar and additional Controllerism. They lean toward boom-bap, but once labeled will immediately transcend and include their experience with existing Belief systems by all Sentient Beings to arrive "beyond genre." There is only 1 Love in the Kosmos... http://frankheiss.com/ http://soundcloud.com/frankheiss Henny Rock Hendrik David Gideonse XIX started his professional music career playing with Thumper, an infamous Boston ska band. He worked as a live mix engineer throughout the 90&#39;s and started producing commercial records around 1998 when he founded Indecent Music. Hendrik also fronted the band Nineteen. Henny Rock has taught audio production and technology at many of the schools in the Boston area. http://indecentmusic.com/ Visuals by VJ Shmeejay $5, 21+, 10 PM 186 Harvard Avenue in Allston "Harvard Avenue" stop on Green line B For this and future events please visit http://www.musicecologyboston.com/ or find us on Facebook at http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology Promotional assistance by: LostinSound http://www.lostinsound.org/ and Forbidden Bass Crew http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790'
