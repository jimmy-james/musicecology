<meta name="description" content="Wheez-ieWheez-ie is a 23 year-old producer/DJ from Houston who specializes in the dancefloor-shaking madness that is bass music. He has already released two EPs this year: the Juke-infused All Worked Up EP on Well Rounded Individuals, and the XLR8R-lauded Keep Yer Chin Up EP for Embassy Recordings, which has been called &quot;pristine and full&quot; &quot;clean and smooth,&quot; and, at the same time, &quot;spastic.&quot;His releases have appeared on the aforementioned Well Rounded Individuals and Embassy Recordings as well as Salva&#39;s infamous Frite Nite label, while his remixes of Distal&#39;s &quot;Coke Bottle&quot; and Zoltan&#39;s &quot;Pawnoramics&quot; appeared on Grizzly and Freshmore, respectively. He&#39;s had support from DJs all around the world, including Machinedrum, Salva, Distal, DJ Rashad, Sines, J da Flex, Canblaster, Sam Tiba Ana Sia, Dubbel Dutch, Nasty Nasty, Dave Q, Donga, Damu Kanji Kinetic, Cedaa, Jackmaster, Cardopusher, Sinden and Mele. As he expands his career and continues releasing music, his entourage of admirers, friends and co-conspirators is only going to expand along with it. http://www.facebook.com/WheezieDubz PrismPrism studied under Vance Gordan [Dicenso&#39;s Drum Shop/First Class Band] specializing in Afro Cuban rhythms and the Moeller technique prior to venturing into music production. Becoming more intrigued by the intricate likeness of all societies, cultures and religions, PRISM was created with a deeper purpose. Not only to showcase all of these influences but to convey an awareness that all things, no matter how different they may appear in physical form, are all the same.Having an ear for deep jazzy tunes and hugely influenced by the early Metalheadz vibe, Prism continues this sound in his selection of dubstep, playing vinyl and unreleased dubs from around the world. Always in tune with the roots of what started both Dubstep and Drum and Bass, Prism&#39;s selection rarely strays away from raw, emotional bass music but contains something for everyone which will insure a good time for all who catches one of his sets. https://www.facebook.com/prismdubGeneral MotorGeneral Motor is a beat fanatic. While he is firmly rooted in 4x4 beats...GM&#39;s sets seamlessly move from techno to house, wobbly basslines and vicious blends of cut time magic. His musical styling showcases his upbringing amongst some of the best in Berlin while cutting his teeth on this side of the pond.&quot;&quot;Since moving to Boston in the early 2000&#39;s, GM has embraced the local electronic dance music scene as his home and continues to contribute by throwing parties and events with DJ crews around town. He co-founded the Berlin/Boston based Electronic Music Blog &quot;&quot;DRINKMUSIK&quot;&quot; and recently worked as the Internet Marketing Coordinator for the second annual Together: New England Electronic Music Festival. After forming SUBduction Productions with 7 other Boston-based DJs, The General has had the pleasure of working with some of Boston&#39;s most successful crews including BASSIC, UnHeardUV, Banana Peel Records, CreateSpace Collab, DUBWISE and several others. Through the events he has organized, GM has been fortunate to play at some of Boston&#39;s favorite venues: Enormous Room, Middlesex Lounge, Good Life, Milky Way, Phoenix Landing, WonderBar, An Tain, Savant Project, Redline, Privus, Middle East...the list goes on. Additionally he has performed with some of his favorite artists from around the globe including Pangaea, DJ Funk, Egyptrixx, B.Rich, Steve Porter, Bakir (of Spit Bros.), Kastle, Appleblim, Incyde and many of Boston&#39;s local DJs to boot. http://mmmmaven.com/SPECIAL GUEST: Cache FloweMashing up idm, dubstep, hip hop, experimental, funk, drum and bass, techno and more, CacheFlowe creates genre-skewing electronic music that&#39;s received acclaim from local and international press. Producing with a computer since 1996, he&#39;s honed an original style that&#39;s defined by complex breakbeats, deep analog basslines, techno-flavored synths, organic instrumentation and contorted samples.CacheFlowe&#39;s live show is a fast-paced smorgasbord of chopped breakbeats and analog synths on 8 channels of audio. He bobs and weaves through an array of electronic genres and tempos, using nothing but sounds and loops from his own productions. A CacheFlowe DJ set is something entirely different, ranging from booty-shaking futuristic dance music to heady downtempo beats, depending on the situation and the crowd. Having recently added original audio-reactive visual projections to his audio performance, he quickly received the &quot;&quot;Best Audio/Visual Performer&quot;&quot; award from Denver&#39;s esteemed Westword magazine.Appearing on official releases alongside the likes of Daedelus, Starkey, Ladytron, Ulrich Schnauss, Mochipet, Twine, Machinedrum, ISAN, Chrissy Murderbot and Brer Rabbit of the Flobots, and sharing the stage with Amon Tobin, Solvent, edIT, Machinedrum, Dizzee Rascal, Rusko, Jeff Parker (Tortoise), DJ Olive (MMW, Sonic Youth), Nels Cline (Wilco) and countless local talents, CacheFlowe has carved out a unique niche as a shape-shifting multimedia artist. http://www.cacheflowe.com http://www.progressvideo.tv http://www.justinefekt.com http://www.plasticsoundsupply.com http://justin30.tumblr.com/ http://www.coloradoexperimental.org 10 PM, $5, 21+ Wonder Bar186 Harvard Avenue in Allston&quot;Harvard Avenue&quot; stop on Green line BMusic Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.
