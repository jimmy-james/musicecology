<p>MUSIC ECOLOGY PRESENTS... Jeff Bujak with Eelko</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Bujak</strong><br />Jeff Bujak is a Northampton, MA based keyboardist/producer/composer  who has designed a new style of intelligent dance music (IDM) that  dives deep into the waters of complex electronica and he&rsquo;s carving a  fresh path in the live-music scene one performance at a time.  Though,  if you ask a Jeff Bujak fan to describe his music, a blank face followed  by a smile would prove to be a common  trial answer, then usually words like &lsquo;dirty&rsquo; and &lsquo;epic&rsquo; start pouring  out.  His music falls into a large pool of electronica dance genres,  lands on one and leaps to the next while he wails away on his keyboards  to create something truly moving, smart and original.<br /><br />Bujak  began his history with the piano at age 7.  He started studying music  theory a couple years later and began understanding the math of music.   Since then, he has written over 300-solo compositions ranging from  standard classical styles to extravagant heavy metal fury.  He looks for  what&rsquo;s been done before and finds a way to recreate the theory with  dance music in a way that hasn&rsquo;t been heard, yet strangely familiar at  the same time.  He handcrafts his own hard-driving beats and loops, then  samples and performs his half improv/ half composed pieces live to  create an experience clearly pushed into it&rsquo;s own category.<br /><br />Jeff Bujak tours live full-time with 4-studio albums, over  120-multitrack live-albums under his belt and enough keyboard/ gadget  wizardry and sequencing know-how to hold the energy in a raging audience  for over 4-hours straight.  Whether it&rsquo;s the two 4 &frac12; hour non-stop sets  on Jam Cruise earlier this year or the countless set-break sets from  last year for The New Deal, Lotus and Eoto, Bujak is perfoming memorable  sets and quickly becoming one of the most talked about solo acts on the  road.<a href=""http://www.jeffbujak.com/"" target=""_blank""><br />http://www.jeffbujak.com/</a><br /><br /><strong>Eelko</strong><br /><br />Eelko, born Christopher Carchedi, is a live performing artist hailing  from Boston, who, with his music, blurs the lines between hip hop, funk,  trance, dubstep, and a plethora of many other influences. Drawing  inspiration from a love of avante garde jazz and free form &lsquo;jam&rsquo; music,  Eelko&rsquo;s live performances are always kept fresh and interesting.<a href=""http://soundcloud.com/eelko"" target=""_blank""><br />http://soundcloud.com/eelko</a><a href=""http://eelkomusic.com/"" target=""_blank""><br />http://eelkomusic.com/</a><br /><br />Visuals by <strong>VJ Shmeejay</strong><br /><br />10 PM, $5, 21+<br /><br />186 Harvard Avenue in Allston<br />""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green line B<br /><br />Our other upcoming events at Wonder Bar:<br />D.V.S* &amp; Creative Common - Oct 25th<br />De Qualia &amp; Probiotic w/ Mixzart - Nov 1st<br />King &amp; Space Jesus - Nov 8th<br /><br />For this and future events please visit<a href=""http://www.musicecologyboston.com/"" target=""_blank""><br />http://www.musicecologyboston.com/</a><br /><br />or find us on Facebook at<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology"" target=""_blank""><br />http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology</a><br /><br />Promotional assistance by:<br /><strong>LostinSound</strong><a href=""http://www.lostinsound.org/"" target=""_blank""><br />http://www.lostinsound.org/</a><br /><br />and <strong>Forbidden Bass Crew</strong><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790"" target=""_blank""><br />http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790</a></p>","\N","2011-10-13 05:37:16+00","2011-10-13 05:38:23+00","1","2011-09-22 08:45:48+00","t","f","122132031215087"

<p>This week we celebrate Shawn Conte's birthday. Shawn aka <strong>FDOT</strong> aka  Furious Styles aka one of The Statesmen aka one of the creators of Music  Ecology has decided to get one year older. To celebrate this occasion  with us we invited Science Factory and Lenore.<br /> <br /><strong> Science Factory</strong><br /> Science Factory is an idea three different people had, and began to  develop soon after meeting. In fact, even after they met, the idea just  kept floating around for awhile. Ideas are like that: floaty.<br /> Daniel Brady (Mixmaster Doc), Bernie Kenerson (Bernzilla) &amp; Sam  Favata (MC Troublepants) might seem an unlikely trio if you met them  outside of a musical context. Brady(26) and Favata(29) met working at a  music store &amp; began swapping ideas on music, culture and the future.<br /> Favata met Kenerson at a local Jazz club jam-session, and became fast  friends. Kenerson, who was already a veteran musician when Sam &amp; Dan  were just kids, brought a wealth of ideas to the group. An undisputed  virtuoso of the Electric Wind Instrument (EWI), Bernie had been playing  &amp; recording modern jazz-fusion, searching for new ways to express  himself on this unique instrument.<br /> Dan Brady realized the potential  of a person who had mastered the EWI. Not only could he play dazzling  solos with an infinite array of sounds, he could also use the instrument  for sampling, filtering, modulation &amp; more.<br /> After a few years  of tinkering, jamming &amp; head-scratching, the lads got serious.  Weekly jam-sessions turned into heavy composition sessions, and a  multitude of shows soon followed.<br /> Science Factory has now become an  idea-in-motion. Need a dancefloor anthem? Got you. Grimy Dub-Step  Hip-Hop? Sure. Downtempo Electro Ballad? Of course.<br /> Science Factory  moves seamlessly between genres, but never loses the audience. Their  shows are designed for both the ""Heads"" as well as the casual listener<br /> <a href=""http://www.reverbnation.com/sciencefactory"" target=""_blank"">http://www.reverbnation.com/sciencefactory</a><br /> <br /><strong> Lenore</strong><br /> The queen bee of DnB and one of the masterminds behind Elements - one of the longest running DnB nights in the country.<br /> <a href=""http://www.elements-dnb.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.elements-dnb.com/</a><br /> <br /> <br /> Visuals by <strong>VJ Shmeejay</strong><br /> <br /> 10 PM, $5, 21+<br /> <br /> 186 Harvard Avenue in Allston<br /> ""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green line B<br /> <br /> Our other upcoming events at Wonder Bar:<br /> Jeff Bujak &amp; Eelko - Oct 18th<br /> D.V.S* &amp; Creative Common - Oct 25th<br /> De Qualia &amp; Probiotic w/ Mixzart - Nov 1st<br /> King &amp; Space Jesus - Nov 8th<br /> <br /> For this and future events please visit<br /> <a href=""http://www.musicecologyboston.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.musicecologyboston.com/</a><br /> <br /> or find us on Facebook at<br /> <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology</a><br /> <br /> Promotional assistance by:<br /><strong> LostinSound</strong><br /> <a href=""http://www.lostinsound.org/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lostinsound.org/</a><br /> <br /> and <strong>Forbidden Bass Crew</strong><br /> <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790</a></p>","\N","2011-10-11 22:04:56+00","2011-10-11 22:04:56+00","1","2011-09-22 08:45:48+00","t","f","275174235838650"

<p>In honor of these special guests, we will start Music Ecology an hour early at 9 PM.<br /> $5 entry from 9 PM - 10:30 PM<br /> $10 after 10:30<br /> Get here early to take advantage of this offer.<br /> <br /> <strong>Heyoka</strong><br /> Over the last five years, Andrei Olenev AKA Heyoka, has been bringing a  unique twist on glitch hop and psychedelic bass music, emerging as a  staple producer and performer throughout the west coast electronic music  scene and burning man community, as well as branching into the  international glitch hop and bass music movements.  Heyoka has brought  his signature sound to festivals such as: Symbiosis, Sonic Bloom,   Raindance, Lightning in a bottle, Big Bounce, Alchemeyez, and large  sound camps of Burning Man such as Nexus, El circo, Temple of Boom,   Entheon Village, Roots Society and Fractal Nation.  He has also brought  his music to several International Festivals such as Shambhala (Canada),   Boom (Portugal), Erthfreq and Winter solstice (Australia), and  Luminate (New Zealand).  Heyoka has a hectic touring schedule throughout  North America, regularly visiting clubs, warehouses and festivals of  various underground music scenes. <br /> Heyoka&rsquo;s sound blends elements of  many musical styles into something that is mind bending and  indefinable. While listening to his music, you are taken on a journey  through fractal soundscapes and alien dimensions, while riding a wave of  fat glitch beats and sub bass.  In his live sets, Heyoka chops up and  remixes his own original music, always keeping it fresh and hot on the  dancefloor.  Heyoka&rsquo;s sound evolves album to album, frequently being  reinvented while maintaining a unique flavor that is unmistakably  &ldquo;Heyoka&rdquo;.  He releases his music mainly on San Francisco&rsquo;s Muti Music, a  leader in the glitch hop and bass music scene.   <br /> The response to  his emergence so far has been overwhelming as Heyoka manages to stand  out amongst bass music producers with an almost cult like following due  to his unique take on all things &lsquo;Glitch&rsquo; and &lsquo;Bass&rsquo; centric. <br /> <a href=""http://www.heyokamusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.heyokamusic.com/</a><br /> <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/heyoka-1"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/heyoka-1</a><br /> <br /><strong> Futexture</strong><br /> Futexture is the exploration of (trans)personal experience through  sound. For David Krantz, former producer of Agobi Project and 22 year  old musician based out of Asheville, NC it is the logical evolution of a  lifelong musical obsession. <br /> Combining the rhythmic appeal of  dubstep and hip hop with melodic dreamscapes and creative sound design,  Futexture skillfully weaves a futuristic blend of glitchy bass-heavy IDM  and jazzy techstep into a forward thinking sound that defies  classification. This unique sonic synthesis is equally suited for both  headphones and the dancefloor, and many have described it as a breath of  fresh air in electronic music today.<br /> A new project as of late 2010,  Futexture has been well received in a variety of musical circles. In  the first six months of 2011 he has shared the stage with Tipper,  Bassnectar, Kilowatts, Nasty Nasty, Bonobo, Ana Sia, Big Gigantic,  Heyoka, Falty DL, Bird of Prey, Mimosa, Mindelixir, and Mount Kimbie,  and Vibesquad. <br /> <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/futexture"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/futexture</a><br /> <br /> <br /> Visuals by <strong>VJ Shmeejay</strong><br /> <br /> 9 PM, $5 before 10:30 &amp; $10 after 10:30, 21+<br /> <br /> 186 Harvard Avenue in Allston<br /> ""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green line B<br /> <br /> Other upcoming events at Wonder Bar:<br /> Science Factory &amp; Lenore - Oct 11th.<br /> Jeff Bujak &amp; Eelko - Oct 18th<br /> D.V.S* &amp; Creative Common - Oct 25th<br /> <br /> For this and future events please visit<br /> <a href=""http://www.musicecologyboston.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.musicecologyboston.com/</a><br /> <br /> or find us on Facebook at<br /> <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology</a><br /> <br /> Promotional assistance by:<br /><strong> LostinSound</strong><br /> <a href=""http://www.lostinsound.org/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lostinsound.org/</a><br /> <br /> and <strong>Forbidden Bass Crew</strong><br /> <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790</a></p>","\N","2011-09-20 18:59:03+00","2011-09-20 19:01:12+00","1","2011-06-20 23:29:29+00","t","f","292314900781280"

He bought some turntables found a warehouse and threw his first  parties in late 2000. A brief trip to London in 2001 and a visit to  Fabric nightclub provided the catalyst to switch styles from DnB to  Breaks. Then in 2005 Pious attended Burning Man and heard Dubstep and  Glitch Hop for the first time and instantly knew this was the sound of  the future. Today you can hear anyone or all of these styles in a Pious  set.<br /> Currently Pious holds down residency at Lost In Bass every Monday on glitch.fm as well as at the Tuesday weekly Music Ecology.<br /> <br /> <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/professorpious"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/professorpious</a><br /> <a href=""http://www.mixcloud.com/professorpious"" target=""_blank"">http://www.mixcloud.com/professorpious</a><br /> <br /> and<br /> <br /><strong> Furious Styles</strong> (The Statesmen, Music Ecology)<br /> Part of Boston-based DnB group The Statesmen as well as one of the  masterminds behind Music Ecology, Furious Styles is known to explode the  dancefloor with his beats that'll make adults and children lose  control. <br /> <br /> <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/statesmendnb"" target=""_blank"">http://www.myspace.com/statesmendnb</a><br /> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Statesmen/114256085260392"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Statesmen/114256085260392</a><br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> Visuals by <strong>VJ Shmeejay</strong><br /> <br /> 9 PM, $5 before 10:30 &amp; $10 after 10:30, 21+<br /> <br /> 186 Harvard Avenue in Allston<br /> ""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green line B<br /> <br /> For this and future events please visit<br /> <a href=""http://www.musicecologyboston.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.musicecologyboston.com/</a><br /> <br /> <br /> or find us on Facebook at<br /> <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology</a><br /> <br /> Promotional assistance by:<br /><strong> LostinSound</strong><br /> <a href=""http://www.lostinsound.org/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lostinsound.org/</a><br /> <br /> and <strong>Forbidden Bass Crew</strong><br /> <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790</a></p>","\N","2011-09-07 03:50:44+00","2011-09-07 03:50:44+00","1","2011-06-20 23:29:26+00","t","f","248674218503970"

Eliciting emotions that range from  respect to disgust to adoration, the fruit has earned the nickname,  ""King of Fruits,"" and has been banned in  many hotels and public areas due to its smell.  No doubt this brash  fruit is an appropriate namesake for the Brooklyn live  Electronic/IDM/Dubstep band, Durians.  The trio's powerful presence and  sound are as impressive and unique as the fruit's funky odor.<br /> <br /> ""...This is live-instrument electronic music on steroids, featuring  dance-inducing break-beats and drum and bass amongst a psychedelic swirl  of sonic delights."" - Ed Dufresne, Montpelier Times Argus, 8/28/09<br /> <br /> Although the group uses recognizable elements from the newest  DJ-dominated Electronic Dance Music genres, Durians never sticks to  formulas.  Dubstep bass lines played from Nick Kirshnit's hybrid bass  are so dirty, aggressive and low that they defy standards of the genre.   Drum n' bass and jazz-infused trip hop beats are pounded so hard by  drummer Ryan Ramirez that they compel even the most reserved  concert-goers to move their feet.  Melodies and sounds from Gnome  Chalmsky's trombone and keyboards are so twisted that they take each  song into a different epic dimension. <br /> <br /> "" ...like Aphex twin and Squarepusher but they take it to the next level..."" - DJ Lovelace, Brooklyn Radio, (Nov 12, 2010)<br /> <br /> The idea began with longtime musical cohorts Kirshnit and Chalmsky in  Burlington, VT.  They had been engrossed by the work of such artists as  Amon Tobin, Squarepusher and Jo-Jo Mayer's Nerve, and the influence that  these artists had on Kirshnit and Chalmsky was large and obvious.  The  success of the project eventually compelled them to move to New York  City, where they met drummer Ryan Ramirez, a recent transplant from  North Carolina.  Ramirez, an already accomplished session drummer with  Soul/Funk ensembles, had been inspired by Electronica drummers such as  Adam Deitch, Jo-Jo Mayer and KJ Sawka.  He, Kirshnit and Chalmsky  clicked and immediately began work on releasing their music.<br /> <br /> After releasing their EP, ""Adrenochrome Gnome,"" Durians have been  growing in notoriety in the North-East.  They find themselves at home in  a variety of scenes, from EDM, to IDM, to Jamtronica, even picking up  fans of jazz and heavy metal.<br /> <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/duriansmusic"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/duriansmusic</a><br /> <a href=""http://duriansmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://duriansmusic.com/</a><br /> <br /> <br /><strong> Svyable</strong> (JG3 Productions)<br /> Svyable exploded onto the dubstep scene in Boston after releasing his  Dashka Stone EP and getting his Monster Ft.

Since then Svyable has turned his focus to  remixing including artists such as Alicia Keys, Innerpartysystem, and  Nenna Yvonne.<br /> <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/svyable"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/svyable</a><br /> <a href=""http://svyable.bandcamp.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://svyable.bandcamp.com/</a><br /> <br /> <br /> Visuals by <strong>VJ Shmeejay</strong><br /> <br /> 10PM, $5, 21+<br /> <br /> 186 Harvard Avenue in Allston<br /> ""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green line B<br /> <br /> For this and future events please visit<br /> <a href=""http://www.musicecologyboston.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.musicecologyboston.com/</a><br /> <br /> <br /> or find us on Facebook at<br /> <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology</a><br /> <br /> Promotional assistance by:<br /><strong> LostinSound</strong><br /> <a href=""http://www.lostinsound.org/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lostinsound.org/</a><br /> <br /> and <strong>Forbidden Bass Crew</strong><br /> <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790</a></p>","\N","2011-09-14 19:11:40+00","2011-09-14 19:11:40+00","1","2011-06-20 23:29:29+00","t","f","161666263919369"

However, his dj sets bring over-the-top sounds from  under-the-radar artists to keep the heads noddin and the butts movin,  Nuff said, just be there.<br /> <br /><strong> Krallspace</strong> (<a href=""http://soundcloud.com/krallspace"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/krallspace</a>)<br /> <br /> That heavy bass sound that sends shivers down your spine and a high  voltage jolt through your veins is the sound that Alex Rivera Krall  prides himself on. With a vast variety of clashing genres of music and  an arsenal of tricks and effects Krallspace vows to wow. A major  contributor to the ever-expanding Boston dubstep scene, Krall has been  assembling... thrilling glitch, dubstep, and hip-hop oriented tracks  that have landed him opportunities to play at several major clubs in  Boston (Middle East Downstairs, Brighton Music Hall, Wonderbar etc...)  and major northeastern festivals in Camp Bisco IV and Desiderata. Alex  has also been able to take the stage alongside several noteworthy acts  in Electronic music some of which include but are not limited to Datsik,  EOTO, 12th Planet, MiMOSA, Two Fresh, Paper Diamond, Daedelus and  Archnemesis while also performing regularly alongisde Boston's own  Terravita (Hot Pink Delorean). Currently residing in Allston  Massachusetts, Krallspace has been hard at work on his debut EP ""Playing  With Fire"" that he will deliver to the hands of the public as a free  download with an expected release in late 2011.<br /> <br /> frankster and Henny Rock present:<br /> THE MIGHTY RUMPUS<br /> (<a href=""http://the-mighty-rumpus.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://the-mighty-rumpus.com/</a>)<br /> <br /><strong> frankster</strong><br /> Frank Heiss has been doing the music thing since he started hitting  things with drum sticks at the age of 4. After his college band opened  for future legends Phish in 1990, a friend played him a hardcore  cassette tape mixed by Nicky Black Market and he never looked back -  selling his acoustic drums in favor of samplers, sequencers,  synthesizers and ultimately an Akai MPC-3000. He immediately saw that  embracing technology and becoming one with machines would allow further  innovation over imitation.<br /> <br /> He was inspired by and introduced to  the world of electronic dance music in the early 1990's by none other  than Dr. Walker of the German electronic duo Air Liquide after the two  were introduced at dawn on Avenue C in New York City Awakening an  eternal space brotherhood. His first vinyl EP Radical Technology was  released in 1995 on the UK label Rising High courtesy of Casper Pound  who rests in Peace at One with The Spirit World. Frank Heiss was further  inducted into the global electronic underground as part of the Liquid  Sky family by Carlos ""Soul"" Slinger who helped dub him tube. His  innovative work as tube has yielded six albums to date pioneering a  sound he calls: Mental Step. The debut tube release Alive was called  ""sonic sorcery"" by CMJ and compared to the likes of Aphex Twin and  Squarepusher.<br /> <br /> Frank Heiss also recorded a multi-genre full  length for Harvest/EMI under the name HearNow, and has created a simply  absurd Country-Western/Breakbeat crossover project known as The Hick  Step Massive. After spending some time focused on producing anonymous  music for television and taking a hiatus from performing live, he has  once again picked up drum sticks and come full circle as an electronic  percussionist.<br /> <br /> The Mighty Rumpus is frankster's latest offering  as an electronic percussionist, having teamed up with master engineer  Henny Rock on baritone guitar and additional Controllerism. They lean  toward boom-bap, but once labeled will immediately transcend and include  their experience with existing Belief systems by all Sentient Beings to  arrive ""beyond genre.""<br /> <br /> There is only 1 Love in the Kosmos...<br /> <br /> <a href=""http://frankheiss.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://frankheiss.com/</a><br /> <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/frankheiss"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/frankheiss</a><br /> <br /> <strong>Henny Rock</strong><br /> Hendrik David Gideonse XIX started his professional music career  playing with Thumper, an infamous Boston ska band. He worked as a live  mix engineer throughout the 90's and started producing commercial  records around 1998 when he founded Indecent Music. Hendrik also fronted  the band Nineteen. Henny Rock has taught audio production and  technology at many of the schools in the Boston area.<br /> <br /> <a href=""http://indecentmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://indecentmusic.com/</a><br /> <br /> <br /> Visuals by <strong>VJ Shmeejay<br /> </strong><br /> $5, 21+, 10 PM<br /> <br /> 186 Harvard Avenue in Allston<br /> ""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green line B<br /> <br /> For this and future events please visit<br /> <a href=""http://www.musicecologyboston.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.musicecologyboston.com/</a><br /> <br /> <br /> or find us on Facebook at<br /> <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology</a><br /> <br /> Promotional assistance by:<br /> <strong>LostinSound</strong><br /> <a href=""http://www.lostinsound.org/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lostinsound.org/</a><br /> <br /> and <strong>Forbidden Bass Crew</strong><br /> <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790</a></p>","\N","2011-09-08 23:02:36+00","2011-09-08 23:02:36+00","1","2011-06-20 23:29:29+00","t","f","216346808421246"

He bought some turntables found a warehouse and threw his first  parties in late 2000. A brief trip to London in 2001 and a visit to  Fabric nightclub provided the catalyst to switch styles from DnB to  Breaks. Then in 2005 Pious attended Burning Man and heard Dubstep and  Glitch Hop for the first time and instantly knew this was the sound of  the future. Today you can hear anyone or all of these styles in a Pious  set.<br /> Currently Pious holds down residency at Lost In Bass every Monday on glitch.fm as well as at the Tuesday weekly Music Ecology.<br /><br /><br /><strong>Ali Berger</strong> - <a href=""http://aliberger.bandcamp.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://aliberger.bandcamp.com/</a><br /><br />*************3$ 21+, 5$ 18+***********DOORS @ 8****************</p>","\N","2011-08-22 18:55:53+00","2011-08-22 18:55:53+00","1","2011-06-20 23:29:26+00","t","f","179705215431967"

<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.8778520496562123"">We've partied like there is no tomorrow. We prepared for all the carnage of the apocalypse. Instead we got a second chance. A chance to create a new world, to raise our faces to the sun, to breathe this new air, to reach out to our fellow human, animal or machine... A chance to finally embrace our differences and build a world unlike any other. We invite you to Genesis. Witness the beginning...<br /><br />We will continue to build this new world in our 4th installment of Genesis - a party brought to you by Music Ecology, VJ Adrenochrome and Kate Van Rees.<br /><br />A life was created at our last party and now the future inhabitants of our world are slowly brewing in their wombs waiting to be born. Studies show that fetuses can hear music which is why so many human mothers listen to the works of classical composers. We want to try and find out what would happen if we played loud bass music to our future offspring. A little nature vs nurture if you will...<br /><br />Parties in charge of loud bass music for the night are<br /><br />TONY GOODS (Sounds of Sumo / Kum Curek / dashexp.com | Seattle) <br /><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/tonygoods"">http://soundcloud.com/tonygoods</a><br /><br />and <br /><br />DJ ZOLA (LostinSound.org, Together | Boston)<br /><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/lostinsound/"">http://soundcloud.com/lostinsound/</a><br /><br />with support by Music Ecology residents <br /><br />Tony Goods AKA Dash EXP<br />Having self-released three successful dubstep mixes (Dub Assassin Series), a 19-track all original mix, and putting out a steady flow of singles, EP's and remixes for notable future-thinking indie labels like Shift. Recordings, Sounds of Sumo, Hot N Heavy, Brap Dem, Betamorph and Phantom Hertz, Dash has showed his versatility in genres with tunes ranging from dubstep, jungle, drum and bass, house, garage and UK funky. The eclecticism of his rhythms lends to a frenzy on the dancefloor, and has bought him continued support and play from leading DJ's, producers and labels worldwide, as well as radio play on BBC Radio 1. This is what Juno downloads had to say about his most recent release ""Friends"":<br />""Review:<br />In its original form, ""Friends"" is a track full of glorious contrasts. At times, it feels like an emotion-rich, melody-heavy tribute to touchy-feely dancefloor classics. At others, it stimulates the hips and feet with bleep-laden rhythms pitched somewhere between tropical, future garage and post-dubstep beats. The deeper, more atmospheric ""Nothing"" redresses the balance slightly, before ""Effed Up"" drags us kicking and screaming towards the dancefloor with some particularly pulsating garage grooves. Of the six accompanying remixes, it's the unashamedly positive vibes of Daniel Klauser that really hits the spot - though Sleverance's retro-futurist rave-up is also worth a listen.<br /><br />-Support from: Doorly, Starkey, Malente &amp; Detboi ""<br /><br />DJ Zola<br />Zola is Charles Mazzola, a writer, inciter, and Resident DJ of the LiS/Use Your Head home party crew. He was captured by the Electronic Dance Music scene and while traveling abroad for several months, his heart stayed in IBIZA. Alas, he is a lover of all forms of music, especially the eclectic. Living, working, and attending as many shows as possible-spreading the word of amazing and underground music. Charles regularly plays established nights around Boston, NY and RI and with touring bands.<br /><br /><br />As always creative attire is encouraged!<br /><br /><br />We hope to see you on Saturday, March 3rd at <br /><br />Machine Nightclub (Fenway)<br />1254 Boylston Street in Boston<br />""Fenway"" or ""Kenmore"" stops on the Green Line<br /> <br />10 PM - 2 AM, 21+, $10 - includes admission to Factory with DJ Static and Volvox (<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/events/380789775269099/"">https://www.facebook.com/events/380789775269099/</a>)</strong></p>

We recommend getting to Wonder Bar before 11 PM since we have only a limited number of tickets available at the door. </strong> <br /><br />Heyoka (Muti Music)<br />Over the last five years, Andrei Olenev AKA Heyoka, has been bringing a unique twist on glitch hop and psychedelic bass music, emerging as a staple producer and performer throughout the west coast electronic music scene and burning man community, as well as branching into the international glitch hop and bass music movements. Heyoka has brought his signature sound to festivals such as: Symbiosis, Sonic Bloom, Raindance, Lightning in a bottle, Big Bounce, Alchemeyez, and large sound camps of Burning Man such as Nexus, El circo, Temple of Boom, Entheon Village, Roots Society and Fractal Nation. He has also brought his music to several International Festivals such as Shambhala (Canada), Boom (Portugal), Erthfreq and Winter solstice (Australia), and Luminate (New Zealand). Heyoka has a hectic touring schedule throughout North America, regularly visiting clubs, warehouses and festivals of various underground music scenes. <br />Heyoka's sound blends elements of many musical styles into something that is mind bending and indefinable. While listening to his music, you are taken on a journey through fractal soundscapes and alien dimensions, while riding a wave of fat glitch beats and sub bass. In his live sets, Heyoka chops up and remixes his own original music, always keeping it fresh and hot on the dancefloor. Heyoka's sound evolves album to album, frequently being reinvented while maintaining a unique flavor that is unmistakably ""Heyoka"". He releases his music mainly on San Francisco's Muti Music, a leader in the glitch hop and bass music scene. <br />The response to his emergence so far has been overwhelming as Heyoka manages to stand out amongst bass music producers with an almost cult like following due to his unique take on all things 'Glitch' and 'Bass' centric. <br /><a href=""http://www.heyokamusic.com/"">http://www.heyokamusic.com/</a><br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F510075&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe></strong></p>

Heavily rooted in traditional band style rock/ funk music, (Floyd, Hendrix, Zeppelin, Phish, all his father's bands, etc..) Jules found electronic music as a pre-teen and immediately was drawn to carefully sculpted, evolving beats, throbbing bass, and euphoric synthetic sound design. Although he didn't start making electronic music for years, he continued to integrate the theory into his drumming and live band. In the summer of 2008, Jules dove head first into the world of EDM production and nocturnal sleep cycles, making everything from electro-house, to dubstep, to krunk - -&amp; styles yet-unnamed. Having already headlined shows including Music Ecology @ Wonderbar Boston, played festivals such as Camp Bisco, Desiderata, and the Big Up, shared the stage with OTT, Lotus, Conspirator, MiMOSA, Michal Menert, Sub Swara, Bluetech, King Britt, Dub War NYC and Psylab, to name a few, AND placed in the International top 8 of the Untz.com's producer competition- the anonymous might not be unknown for long...</strong> <br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F518177&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br />SPECIAL THANKS TO GigaFunk Live, LLC for providing us with bass music appropriate sound!<br /><a href=""http://www.campcoldbrook.com/gigafunklive/"">http://www.campcoldbrook.com/gigafunklive/</a><br /><br />10 PM, $12, 21+<br /><br /><br />Wonder Bar<br />186 Harvard Avenue in Allston<br />""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green line B<br /><br />Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

<p>Music Ecology is proud to host a second installment of the Bass Embassy  Invasion featuring Diode/Johhny Braap/Andis/ and Elijah Divine<br /><br />Based  Out of Worcester, Massachusetts, USA, Puertorican Producer, Diode (Alex  Alejandro), has been making his mark in Drum &amp; Bass culture for a  few years now. His hard work and effort have been turning heads all over  the globe. His diverse yet complex approach to the art of producing  drum&rsquo;n&rsquo;bass has allowed labels to sign  and release various tracks for the masses to enjoy. His first releases  began in 2005 on Signal Recordings UK with Cyclone/Final Night along  side Position Chrome's heavy weight producer, Cooh.<br /><br />In 2007,  <strong>Diode</strong> signed to Close 2 Death Records (UK). The tracks ""No More Time""  and ""Noise"" were the first of many tracks to get signed to the label. In  2008 Diode came stronger then ever with the bass wrenching hit ""No  Man's Land,"" hitting top 20 on Nu Urban's Release Charts for Close 2  Death records as well as ""Power Junkie,"" for Close 2 Death via Beatport.  Ending 2008, Diode and Cooh tagged again under the alias ""HARM"" and  released ""Headstomp"" on well versed Prospect Recordings.<br /><br />2009 has  seen an assortment of tracks on various labels. Close 2 Death Records  release of the dance floor hit Diode - Krion. Ammunition Recordings has  the Diode - Time Soldier EP featuring First Kick, Binary, and Primal.  Abducted Recordings is slangin' Antimatter / Dirt Nap. Belgium  nuero-funk label, Mindtech Recordings has the Diode - Record Breaker EP.<br /><br />Going  into 2011, Alex Alejandro developed his alter ego and created the  dubstep project ""SWAGG"" aka SWAGGATRON. With the first release of ""Badd /  Like It Loud"" on Subchamber Records and highly anticipated debut EP on  Abducted Records as well as a release on Ammunition Recordings  sub-label, Caliberm, Swagg is on a roller coaster ride of beats  containing gut wrenching basslines!!!! Don't blink, Diode is still  grinding out heavy tracks and with 2011 already seeing the ""End of the  Stereo"" EP released on international producer, Kryteria's label, Krypled  Brain Records.<br /><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/DIODEDNB"" target=""_blank"">http://WWW.MYSPACE.COM/DIODEDNB</a><br /><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/SWAGGONE"" target=""_blank"">http://WWW.MYSPACE.COM/SWAGGONE</a><br /><a href=""http://www.soundcloud.com/SWAGGATRON"" target=""_blank"">http://WWW.SOUNDCLOUD.COM/SWAGGATRON</a><br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/ALEXALEJANDRO1"" target=""_blank"">http://WWW.FACEBOOK.COM/ALEXALEJANDRO1</a><br /><br /><br /><strong>Johnny Braap</strong> ~ (Dubstep.FM, MA)<br /><br />Johnny  Braap is quickly gaining momentum in the New England bass music scene.  Braap spent the early stages of his 10+ years in the game mixing jungle  and DnB. His focus has recently shifted to highly aggressive dubstep,  drumstep and filthy filth, often incorporating a hint of tech house to  balance the attack. In 2011 alone, ""J-Braap"" has destroyed dancefloors  at Bassdrop and Wicked Womp Wednesdays in Rhode Island, while holding a  residency at Bass Embassy in Massachusetts. He has been a regular  performer on NEBA's ""Bassface Radio"" show on dubstep.fm, with listeners  across the globe.

<p><strong>Outlet</strong> (<a href=""http://outletmusic.net/"" target=""_blank"">http://outletmusic.net/</a>)<br /> <br />Jonathan  Belfontaine, otherwise known as Outlet, was destined to make music from  the very beginning. At a young age, Jon was given a guitar. Soon  afterward, he stumbled upon a broken amp, took it apart and put it back  together into working condition. Having an incredible ear for music, he  was able to pick out notes, and play along with any song. Over the years,  he's played in different rock bands,... but his musical interest never  stopped at just the guitar, always picking up a bass or a set of  drumsticks. While being influenced in different genres of rock, he also  became deeply integrated into the electronic scene. Soon he had a  keyboard and was experimenting with making music all his own, with  psychedelic melodies and hypnotic tones, empowered with heavy  instrumentals. After a brief hiatus, his burning passion was reignited  when he and his soul mate Elisabeth Marcoux went to Rothbury's music  festival in Michigan. Hearing the mind blowing artists perform with such  love and high energy, and being immersed in the unified and uplifted  crowd, sparked Jon's need to make music again. They immediately went out  and bought him a Juno G. The new keyboard, paired with his discovery of  Ableton Live, allowed him to explode into creativity again, this time  integrating the sounds of hip hop, soul, funk and trance. He has now  been producing a dance oriented, groove inspired, glitchy style of music  that is energetic, passionate and fun. Of course, infusing his positive  vibrations and inspiring light, baked into every morsel of each  tantalizing song. The concoction of organic sounds whipped and blended  with original bass lines and drum patterns, along with his ability to  manipulate the texture and flavor of each synthesized note will leave  the listener delighted in savoring every delicious layer baked into  every song!<br /><br /><strong>Creative Common</strong> (<a href=""http://soundcloud.com/creativecommon"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/creativecommon</a>)<br /><br />support from:<br /><br /><strong>eelko</strong> (<a href=""http://eelko.bandcamp.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://eelko.bandcamp.com/</a>)</p>","\N","2011-07-27 19:33:17+00","2011-08-30 05:04:50+00","1","2011-06-20 23:29:29+00","t","f","269038246456726"

Already a DJ on a  local radio station he switched formats and DJ PARALLAX, as he is  known, was born.<br /><br />Spinning 6 hours at a time On-Air he began  mixing and blending different styles of dance music. &ldquo;Earth Electronic&rdquo;,  his radio program on WXPL 91.3 FM, continued for 5 long years.

<p><strong>Little People</strong><br /><br />You could be forgiven for thinking that growing up  in the Swiss alps in the 90&prime;s wouldn&rsquo;t exactly be the best place to be  exposed to some of the best underground hip hop New York had to offer at  the time. However anglo-swiss producer Laurent Clerc AKA Little People,  argues he couldn&rsquo;t have been in a better place. Thanks to the forward  thinking programming of Laurent&rsquo;s local radio station and a...  DJ with his finger on the pulse of a golden age in the making in New  York &ndash; Laurent&rsquo;s musical education in all things hip hop was of the  highest order. An old Mac and a stack of old LPs were mere catalysts for  Laurent to try and emulate the sounds from across the pond.<br /><br />A  subsequent move to the UK introduced electronica to his broadening taste  and influenced his own sound. Then followed work soundtracking short  films and theater productions which added a cinematic element to his  repertoire. Following a disheartening stint doing some production work  for a Paris based hip hop label convinced Laurent that he should be  doing things on his own terms. A self released EP led to being picked up  by Illicit Recordings in London &ndash; through which &ldquo;Mickey Mouse  Operation&rdquo; was eventually released. This was 2006 and his debut album  only made a very modest splash. Over the past 4 years it has however  turned into something of a sleeper &lsquo;hit&rsquo; &ndash; gathering fervent support in  the US and slowly climbing the US iTunes electronic chart in the  process. Laurent seems to have timed the release of his second album  perfectly &ndash; due to drop in Spring next year just as the interest in his  first album is peaking.<br /><br />Little people&rsquo;s sound is part beats,  bleeps and snippets of other people&rsquo;s music. Stemming from hip hop, it  effortlessly combines warm synths, intricate melodies and string  arrangements. The cinematic quality of his sound led to his music being  used on CSI and other shows in the US and UK.<br /><br />Little people&rsquo;s  upcoming album sees Laurent shift his focus away from what he feels is  the over reliance of samples in his genre, towards composition and the  use of organic instrumentation &ndash; whilst keeping the trademark warmth of  an old piece of vinyl. However rest assured, the beats and the synth  bleeps are still very much on the menu.<br /><br /><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/littlepeoplemusic/"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/littlepeoplemusic/</a><br /><a href=""http://www.littlepeoplemusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.littlepeoplemusic.com/</a><br /><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/littlepeoplemusic"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/littlepeoplemusic</a><br /><br /><strong>czARgb</strong><br /><br />Born in Puerto Rico, Aurelio Ramos (Czargb) is a Boston based producer of electronic entertainment.<br /><br />With  an ear for downtempo grooves, crunchy beats and an eclectic blend of  old school influenced song structures Aurelio's tracks are trully one of  a kind in the modern EDM ecosystem.<br /><br />Trained in the black arts of  semiconductor seduction, Aurelio has expanded from music production  into mixed media art, live video and installation art.<br /><br /><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/aurelio"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/aurelio</a><br /><a href=""http://www.purplenoise.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.purplenoise.com/</a><br /><br /><strong>Ali Berger</strong><br /><br />Ali  Berger is a producer, DJ, and live PA from Princeton, NJ, now living in  Boston.

Join us for a film screening and learn how  mushrooms are being used to clean up toxic oil waste on indigenous lands  in the Ecuadorian Amazon.  Please visit the event page below for more  details.<br /> <br /><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=214760778557783"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=214760778557783</a><br /><br />...At 10 PM see Music Ecology taken over by the forces of <strong>UnheardUV</strong> crew who will bring you:<br /><br /><strong>Mammox</strong> (Psychedelevator)<br />Mammox  formed in April 2009 with Mark C. Aylward (vocals), Nate Belasco  (keyboards), James Staub (bass), and Zachary Zukowski (drums). Together  they introduce a psychedelic collaged sound rooted in hip-hop, glitch,  electronic, and world music. In attempt to describe their music, the  band stated:<br />&ldquo;We are not merely fusing styles&ndash;hybrid groups are  nothing new. We are breathing new life into the music we sample by  mixing it with our own instrumental improvisation and Mark&rsquo;s distinctive  wordplay.&rdquo;<br />Not only is their music unconventional, their entire band  process has also strayed from the ordinary. They created an album  first, learned their songs on traditional instruments afterward, and,  lastly, picked a band name.<br />Unlike many laptop music artists, Mammox  is raising the bar in regards to live performances. Although the music  is largely composed of samples, the band performs with a combination of  traditional instruments and live electronics.<br /><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/mammox"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/mammox</a><br /><a href=""http://mammoxmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://mammoxmusic.com/</a><br /><a href=""http://mammox.bandcamp.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://mammox.bandcamp.com/</a><br /><a href=""http://myspace.com/mammoxmusic"" target=""_blank"">http://myspace.com/mammoxmusic</a><br /><br /><strong>Birthdays</strong> (Allston, MA)<br /><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/birthdayboyforever"" target=""_blank"">http://www.myspace.com/birthdayboyforever</a><br /><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/BIRTHDAYS/111494105532074"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/BIRTHDAYS/111494105532074</a><br /><br /><strong>Tactical Lisp</strong> (Psychedelevator)<br />Tactical  Lisp is Nate Belasco and Zack Zukowski. Every track is an experiment  unto itself, and no attempt is made at cohesion. Electronics are  exploited with reckless abandon, the song structures are haphazard but  organic,  the vocal layers are devoid of meaning, and the drum beats are  mechanically absurd. This is the best tribe-wave doom-step you&rsquo;ve never  heard.<br /><br />Check out Tactical Lisps premeire full-length album Emergence available on Bandcamp<br /><a href=""http://psychedelevator.bandcamp.com/album/emergence"" target=""_blank"">http://psychedelevator.bandcamp.com/album/emergence</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://psychedelevator.com/artists/tactical-lisp/"" target=""_blank"">http://psychedelevator.com/artists/tactical-lisp/</a><br /><br /><strong>Pressplay</strong> (Unhearduv.com)<br />A  boston based DJ focusing on danceable synth leads surrounded by the  dirtiest of bass lines.

EDM dilettantism  and general disillusionment soaring at a fever pitch. For Mikey Lee,  early 2008 resembled a topography of dark and untimely events, and the  assemblage of lush, listless bedroom tunes was the most powerful  antidote.<br /><br />...A  point of return was realized in the eponymous track ""Heath Ledger"" --  an ode to troubled dynamism and superficial fascination in the wake of  the subject's overdose.

<p><strong>Split Phase</strong> (formerly Synewave) is a live electronic duo consisting of  Carl 'transient' Martin on keys and live electronics with Mike McIntosh  on acoustic/electric drums and samples. Split Phase has been hard at  work creating and developing a unique, energetic, and refreshing sound  all their own. Experimenting with influences ranging from house to drum  and bass and jazz to funk, they tap an eclectic mix of styles to weave  their ...sonic tapestries.<br /><br />Carl's  vast music experience spans the last 17 years. Stemming from his solo  project 'transient' (1994-2010), which includes a discography of 475+  tracks spanning more than 38 hours covering a multitude of genres.<br /><br />Over  the past 4 years Mike has established himself as a rhythmical genius  with his sticks. Honing in on his style and learning new skills along  the way while constantly challenging himself with odd timings and beats  on every track.<br /><br />With the recent release of Split Phase's new EP  titled 'Hooves Clackle', Mike and Carl have brought a reinvented and  redefined sound to the forefront, while still staying true to their  roots.<br /><br />From the beginning Split Phase has been a constantly  evolving force adapting a do it yourself mentality in and out of the  studio, from music production, recording and mastering all of the tracks  in house. This combined with the live lighting and visual projections  by Nate VanSlyke make for a must see live music experience.<br /><br />Split  Phase's previous accomplishments include playing the 15th Annual New  York State Harvest Festival, Camp Bisco 8 &amp; 9, the Utica Music and  Arts festival, along with many other venues throughout the NorthEast. <br /><a href=""http://www.splitphase.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.splitphase.com/</a> <br /><br /><strong>EJ3 Robot</strong><br />EJ3  robot is a musical aficionado of sorts, who uses keyboards, guitars,  samples and looping devices to produce unique blends of funk, trip hop,  jazz, blues, trance and jam rock, while also invading and meshing other  genres of electronic music .

Their music consists of a variety of glitched out heavy weighted hip hop  beats, electronic soundscapes laced with organic spirit and a mix of  rhymes and melodic grit smuggled from the demented minds of their two  vocalists. Using samples, synths, guitars, live percussion, deep bass  and even the...  occasional effected trombone, their sets are designed for the dance  floor combining elements of Indie Pop, hip-hop/club and EDM. Along with  an extensive catalog of originals, Lady Sas sets are known to include  unexpected mash-ups and live remixes.<br /><a href=""http://www.ladysas.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.ladysas.com/</a><br /><a href=""http://www.soundcloud.com/ladysasquatch"" target=""_blank"">http://www.soundcloud.com/ladysasquatch</a><br /><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/ladysasquatchmusic"" target=""_blank"">http://www.myspace.com/ladysasquatchmusic</a><br /><br />NeTempo<br />Bouncing  off the streets of Boston, Massachusetts comes the newly formed  electronica duo NeTempo. Composed of long time friends and collaborators  Greg Nickerson (aka DJ Jaminic) and Joe Petit, the two have been  lighting the underground Boston scene on fire with their versatile blend  of house, dub, and breakbeat rhythms. <br />With influences ranging from  the deep house styling&rsquo;s of DJ Dan and Sebastian Leger, the psychedelic  madness of Simon Posford, and the lighter down tempo feel of Bonobo and  Bluetech, Nickerson and Petit have been putting together complex sets  that delight audiences with tastes of the exotic while anchoring them  with touches of the familiar. <br />And while Nickerson has extended his  musical reach to broader audiences in opener and set break performances  for artists like EOTO, Big Gigantic, Orchard Lounge, and Benga, teaming  up with Petit has allowed the duo to tighten their discipline and give  the project a more dynamic feel. <br />And though the duo are constantly  improving and expanding into riskier musical territory, NeTempo is  already throwing dance floors into ecstatic motion with headlining  performances in the greater Boston area. <br />So keep your eyes peeled  and your ears open, because every day Nickerson and Petit are finding  new ways to pleasure your eardrums.

<p><strong>Mr. Rogers</strong><br />The primal sounds and playful style of Mr. Rogers have  long captivated the West Coast underground arts community, but now the  secret is out and this pioneering producer is poised to conquer the far  reaches of the dance floor with his twisted, psychedelic take on  bass-heavy midtempo and glitch-ridden breaks. <br />Capturing laughter and light in his strange sonic vibrations, Mr. Rogers has been DJing for over twelve years and...  producing for five. With innovative textures and vibrant melodies, his  sound is a frothy mix of broken beats, hip hop-based IDM, experimental  whomp and outer space crispiness with a tinge of trip hop.  <br />Mr.  Rogers&rsquo; refreshing sense of levity is craftily expressed through his  music, which always delivers a powerful punch to the dance floor. Funky  and fun, Mr. Rogers&rsquo; beats have bounced faces off crowds at almost every  major music festival on the West Coast, including Shambhala,  EMRG+N+SEE, Alchemeyez, The Big Bounce, Priceless, Stilldream, Raindance  Campout, Symbiosis Gathering and Burning Man. <br />Mr. Rogers&rsquo; latest  album, Licking Crystals, was released on his own label Ooze System  Recordings and blazed into the year&rsquo;s top 25 on Addictech charts in less  than a month with its juicy sound synthesis and signature funky groove.

<p><strong>Music Ecology</strong> Presents a night of all original live EDM featuring:<br /><br /><strong>Sistine Criminals</strong> (<a href=""http://sistinecriminals.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://sistinecriminals.com/</a>)<br />Originally  founded in Boston in 2005 by saxophonist Aaron Burnett and drummer Greg  ""TORCH"" Sgrulloni, Sistine Criminals is a live experience like no other  whether fully acoustic or plugged in. The music is a fusion of modern  electronic dance genres such as drum n bass, house, dubstep, IDM, and  hip-hop with the...  creative/intellectual influences of jazz, classical, and world music.  The Sistine Criminals strive to successfully emulate the vibe of a live  DJ while simultaneously producing the intensity and chemistry that can  only exist between a live group of musicians.<br /><br />Sistine Criminals is based in Brooklyn and is currently active in the underground party and live music scene in New York City.<br /><br />""The Sistine Criminals add elements of jazz to their Drum n Bass/Ghettotech Beats.""- TWO.ONE.FIVE Magazine<br /><br />""Only  in the presence of JoJo Mayer have i seen a purely acoustic band create  such hot music in this genre."" - J.

Heavily rooted in traditional band style  rock/ funk music, (Floyd, Hendrix, Zeppelin, Phish, all his father's  bands, etc..) Jules found electronic music as a pre-teen and immediately  was drawn to carefully sculpted, evolving beats, throbbing bass, and  euphoric synthetic sound design. Although he didn't start making  electronic music for years, he continued to integrate the theory into  his drumming and live band. In the summer of 2008, Jules dove head first  into the world of EDM production and nocturnal sleep cycles, making  everything from electro-house, to dubstep, to krunk - -&amp; styles  yet-unnamed. Having already headlined shows including Music Ecology @  Wonderbar Boston, played festivals such as Camp Bisco, Desiderata, and  the Big Up as well as having shared the stage with OTT, Lotus, Sub  Swara, Bluetech, King Britt, Dub War NYC and Psylab, to name a few, the  anonymous might not be unknown for long...<br /><br />Visuals by our resident <strong>VJ Shmeejay</strong><br /><br />10 PM, $5, 21+<br />186 Harvard Avenue in Allston<br />""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green line B<br /><br />For this and future events please visit<br /><a href=""http://www.musicecologyboston.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.musicecologyboston.com/</a><br />or find us on Facebook at<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology</a><br /><br />Promotional assistance provided by:<br /><strong>LostinSound</strong><br /><a href=""http://www.lostinsound.org/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lostinsound.org/</a><br /><br />and <strong>Forbidden Bass Crew</strong><br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790</a></p>","\N","2011-03-24 20:07:55+00","2011-03-24 20:07:55+00","1","2011-03-11 21:58:40+00","t","f","134464646626618"

<p><strong>Heyoka</strong> AKA Andrei Olenev is a cosmic auditory scientist  found in the Bay Area noosphere, who has been blowing minds with his  sonic manipulations.<br />...Muti  Music first released Heyoka&rsquo;s &ldquo;Space Case EP&rdquo; in 2008 and included him  on their growing roster of talented artists. His albums &lsquo;Whomp Gland  &amp; Pineal Dub&rsquo;, &lsquo;Gate Code&rsquo; and the all new &lsquo;Marklar&rsquo; album in 2010  have shown that he is a producer consistently evolving his musical style  while managing to maintain a signature sound that is distinctively  &lsquo;Heyoka&rsquo;.<br /><br />His early influences in Downtempo, Dub and IDM combined  with midtempo dancefloor genres have helped create a very unique sound  that combines relentless basslines, hip hop rhythms, dub vibes, and  musicality and melody, all within an atmosphere of heavy psychedelia and  alien dimensions. The response to his emergence so far has been  overwhelming with Heyoka developing audiences and playing festivals from  US to Canada and Australia.</p>

<p>Colorado&rsquo;s  <strong>Octopus Nebula</strong> has recently opened up on the scene, impressing  audiences far and wide with their new style of music that blends  elements of electronic, ambient, downtemps, breakbeat, rock, acid jazz,  and ethereal grooves.<br />Originally formed in 2004, the current  incarnation coalesced in 2008 and consists of Fleeb Thomas on bass,  Robin Bloch on guitar, John Safarik on keys, and Dan Raasch on drums.  These musicians have come together not only to inspire the dance floor  (which they do on a regular basis), but also to spread positive  vibrations through music.<br />The rise of Octopus Nebula has been swift  and complete, as was evidenced at the first show they ever played  together, a sold-out gig at Colorado&rsquo;s famous Mishawaka Amphitheater  with musical icons from across the pond, Shpongle and Ott. In addition  to these two major names, Octopus Nebula has shared the stage with such  heavy-hitters as the Disco Biscuits, Random Rab, Bluetech, Lotus, David  Murphy (of STS9), Ana Sia, Eskmo, Boombox, Signal Path, EOTO, and RJD2.<br />Currently  laying out the textured psychedelic grooves for their first album,  Octopus Nebula shuns the formulaic in favor of a purely original sound, a  gamble that has paid off in the long run for this talented quartet. The  music refuses to be classified and, as a result, gives the sense that  the members of Octopus Nebula are truly breaking new ground.</p>

<p><strong>Etheric Double Soundsystem </strong><br /><br />Within the material body of all  living organisms exist currents of energy called &ldquo;ether&rdquo;, providing life  and health. The flow, distribution, and storage of this energy takes  place within a field that surrounds and permeates the body. This field  is called the &ldquo;etheric double&rdquo;. The etheric double supplies the physical  body with the vitality necessary for its existence and well b...eing.  The relationship between the body and the etheric double is equivalent  to that of a battery and the electricity within it. <br />Etheric Double is a producer using music as a means to raise social and environmental awareness. Projects include:<br /><br />Etheric  Double Soundsystem: Experimental live pa experience, fusing a variety  of music styles into a cohesive mix of sounds, commonly referred to as  groove sorcery. Meant to awaken and inspire the listener to reconnect  with their animalistic roots, the music of Etheric Double Soundsystem,  though unorganic in nature, calls on us to abandon the confines of our  industrial cages and embrace the primal archetypes within.<br /><br />Resident  Anti-Hero: Guerilla Hop at its finest. Resident Anti-Hero is a two  piece live fusion of electronic dance music and hip-hop. Focused on the  development of an ongoing mythology, the group utilizes the metaphor of  &lsquo;man vs. machine&rsquo; to create musical stories meant to inspire the  downfall of industrial civilization.<br /><br />Apostle &amp; Etheric  Double: Etheric Double co-produced and created the music for Heavyweight  Dub Champion emcee Apostle&rsquo;s 2007 solo album &lsquo;Lyrical Activism&rsquo;. The  two have reunited to create a live show fusing spoken word poetry with  electronic dance music.

<p><br />The  <strong>Serial Krusher</strong> was created as a two-headed audio/visual entity in late  2005 in Portland, OR, by Ian Lippincott and Rik Maihos (RIP). It started  while experimenting with circuit-bent Nintendo games for use both in  the music and live visuals, then moved into mashing up obscure horror  and sci-fi movie samples. The sonic styles borrow from elements of  8-bit, drum n bass, idm, dubstep, and breakcore. Rik moved away before  things really took off and since that time Ian has VJed for artists such  as: Bit Shifter, Nullsleep, Machine Drum, Daedelus, the Flashbulb,  Doormouse, Otto von Schirach, and Venetian Snares.<br />Sadly, Rik passed  away in October of 2008 at 28 years old. Ian currently lives in Boston,  works as a freelance graphic designer and just self-released his debut  EP  ""A Show of Hands"".</p>

His spaceship leaks  beats to the outer edges of the galaxy, leaving a blast of subterranean  ill bass in his wake. Creatures are drawn to these sounds, regularly  converging in large groups to observe and move to his music.  <br /><br />Taking  cues from classic electronic acts like Kraftwerk, The Art of Noise, and  Front 242, VibeSquaD incorporates the reliable sounds of Chicago,  Detroit, Miami, and the UK, informs it with his background in classic  rock, psychedelic jam, and diverse jazz roots, then zaps it all with  neon lasers. <br /><br />The sounds he produces transmit positivity capable  of inducing anything from temporary stress relief to outright elation.  Tracks from his album Joyful Noise cause a type of heightened euphoria  in fans, leading them to shake and bounce uncontrollably and convince  their robot and alien friends to voyage thousands of light years just to  witness his massive dance parties.  <br /><br />VibeSquaD&rsquo;s launch pad is  in Denver, Colorado (North America), but he travels all over the planet  spreading bouncy beats, elastic synth lines, glitched-out samples and  wobbly bass to gyrating, electrified masses. <br /><br /><strong>R/D</strong><br />In 1999, R/D  and his former DJ partner were invited to help throw a party for the  closing of Perry Farrell&rsquo;s studio in Venice Beach, CA. <br />Eventually  R/D started making his own music on borrowed gear, hammering out  glitched up IDM and electro on an MPC 2000. Luckily, the first tracks he  ever wrote were later released on Andrea Parker&rsquo;s UK label &lsquo;Touchin&rsquo;  Bass&lsquo;. As the era of Aphex Twin influenced IDM came to an end, R/D  virtually hung up his hat, turning to film sound as a creative outlet.  But, his musical nature was re-invigorated in 2006 when he moved in with  pals edIT and Ooah, just as the Glitch Mob sound was forming. Feeding  off the fresh energy of his incredibly talented roommates, he went back  to the drawing board, developing his take on glitch-hop inspired tunes  aimed at the dancefloor. His new sound fetched him gigs at Coachella  with the Do Lab in 2007 and 2009, and put him on the West Coast festival  circuit where he shared bills with Flying Lotus, Pretty Lights,  Bassnectar, The Glitch Mob, Les Claypool, Cocoe Rosie, Caspa, Mala,  Beats Antique, Mimosa, MartyParty and a laundry list of incredible  talent.<br /><br />Recently, R/D has traded the bleeps and bloops of  glitch-hop for pure melody and song structure, and as his music matures,  so does his career. In March of 2010, R/D unleashed an un-official  remix of Fever Ray&rsquo;s &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Not Done&rsquo;, which reached #2 on both Hype  Machine charts and reaped 20,000 listens in 3 days on SoundCloud alone.  So far this year, he has played alongside Krazy Baldhead (Ed Banger),  performed at a Bassnectar aftershow with MartyParty and played live for a  crowd of more than 2,000 at Coachella 2010 (the Do Lab stage). He&rsquo;s  scheduled to perform live at this year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Lightning in a Bottle&rsquo;  festival and he&rsquo;s currently negotiating a record deal, poised to release  several singles and a full length album later this year.<br /><br />Thank you's to:<br /><strong>Wobblesauce</strong> <br /><a href=""http://www.theuntz.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.theuntz.com/</a><br /><a href=""http://autonomousmusic.org/"" target=""_blank"">http://autonomousmusic.org/</a><br /><a href=""http://autonomousmusic.org/"" target=""_blank""></a></p>","\N","2011-01-15 23:30:16+00","2011-02-03 00:21:53+00","1","2011-01-15 23:14:10+00","t","f","189822434362185"

<p><strong>Ample Mammal</strong> (AKA The Polish Ambassador)<br />An expert composer of  glitchy vocals, mashed-up beats and strong, catchy synth melodies, San  Franciso-based Ample Mammal (David Sugalski, aka The Polish Ambassador)  is quickly becoming the West Coast, more sophisticated version of Girl  Talk &ndash; a one man, eight channel master of mixing samples, kinetic beats,  sliced up vocals and elegant atmospheric effects and cres...cendos.  Unlike Girl Talk, however, Sugalski&rsquo;s music is primarily original  material, but heavy with mashed-up sounds and samples that are tweaked  to near unrecognizability, ala The Chemical Brothers. <br /><br />Known for  his energetic live laptop/midi sets as The Polish Ambassador - bouncing  up and down in a signature vintage Swiss jumpsuit, (which he&rsquo;s  considering insuring) and using 5-7 channels - Ample Mammal&rsquo;s debut  14-track album demonstrates Sugalski&rsquo;s typical intense vitality and  animal charm. However, &ldquo;Mating Season&rdquo; is a more varied, downtempo  departure from his more high-energy, kitchy alter ego The Polish  Ambassador. The jumpsuit is gone and the songs exhibit a more  intelligent and intricate artistry. <br /><br />The track titles are ripe  with science references. And, the mixology, concoctions and cutting and  splicing are evident in each track. If a science lab project and an  after-hours underground party collided, it might sound like Ample  Mammal. <br /><br />Already getting heavy play on Pandora and local Bay Area  radio stations including Berkeley&rsquo;s KALX, Ample Mammal is bringing his  highly unique sound to the oft-times formulaic and duplicitous  electronic dance genre. And, he&rsquo;s poised to find his infectious dance  music and live performances embraced by a larger International audience.</p>

The vocal samples  are tasteful, emotional and spiritual colors that take the human voice  into a melodic fragment world reminiscent of late Miles Davis trumpet  work. The record tells a story from beginning to end, has a musical arc  from first track to last track and employs real theme and development  within each composition.

<p><strong>Durians</strong> (NY)<br />&ldquo;...an ambitious and highly danceable experiment,  recalling STS9 at their most electro, or perhaps Daft Punk at their most  organic...&rdquo; - Dan Bolles, 7Days Magazine, Burlington, VT Dec 15th, 2010<br />...<br />Named  after the south-east Asian ""King of Fruits,"" this powerful Electronica  band is a boundary-buster.  The three-piece group plays original music  in the styles of Drum n' Bass, Nu-Jazz, Dub-step, House, and  Psychedelia.  Their live vibe is high-energy, intense, psychedelic, and  often humorous, incorporating live visuals, gnome costumes and handing  out strange Durians-themed prizes.  The music itself is heavy, organic,  anthemic and laden with improvisation.  The musicians play a network of  instrument-machines, controlled not only by MIDI instruments like  keyboards and pads, but also by heavily modified acoustic instruments,  such as trombone, trumpet, MIDI-fied bass guitar, recorder, MIDI-fied  theremin and live drums.<br /><br />""...This is live-instrument electronic  music on steroids, featuring dance-inducing break-beats and drum and  bass amongst a psychedelic swirl of sonic delights."" - Ed Dufresne,  Montpelier Times Argus, 8/28/09<br /><br />The troupe began in Burlington,  VT with multi-instrumentalists Eli Chalmer and Nick Kirshnit, as well as  drummer Spurl Posilac. Chalmer and Kirshnit were classically trained as  youths to be orchestral musicians, and they combine this training with  influence from such artists as Bonobo, the Cinematic Orchestra,  Radiohead, Sonic Youth, Amon Tobin, Infected Mushroom and Squarepusher  to invent their new sound.<br /><br />"" ...like Aphex twin and Squarepusher  but they take it to the next level..."" - DJ Lovelace, Brooklyn College  Radio, (Nov 12, 2010)<br /><br />On June 1st, the band re-located to New  York City and picked up a new drummer, Bushwick resident Ryan Ramirez.  With Ramirez, the group blasted forth with new live grimy Dub-step  techniques and blazing drum n' bass anthems. The group has since  self-released an EP entitled ""Adrenochrome Gnome."" The EP is available  at <a href=""http://www.duriansmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">www.duriansmusic.com</a> and in Itunes, Rhapsody, and other mp3 stores.</p>

<p><strong>Eelko </strong><br />Eelko,  born Christopher Carchedi, is a live performing artist hailing from  Boston, who, with his music, blurs the lines between hip hop, funk,  trance, dubstep, and a plethora of many other influences. Drawing  inspiration from a love of avante garde jazz and free form &lsquo;jam&rsquo; music,  Eelko&rsquo;s live performances are always kept fresh and interesting.<br /><br />Helping  him to achieve keeping live performance as live as possible is the use  of the device known as the Monome.

<p><strong>Ammon EP</strong> (Sonic Beating)<br />A  DJ since the age of 16, Ammon's Journey began upon seeing his parents  dancing to the James Brown he was playing at a small family gathering.  From that point he began to pursue an understanding of every form of  dance/electronic music that the mid to latter 90's had to offer, from  Hip-Hop, Old School Funk, Drum n' Bass, IDM, Trip-Hop, Goa, Big Beat,  House, Trance and all variants in between.<br /><br />Around 98' he was  exposed to Psychedelic Trance and was immediately drawn to its deep  tribal roots and its diverse musical range. For the next 8 years he was  primarily a Psy Trance DJ. Upon moving to Boston he began working at the  infamous Satellite Records where he met a befriended many of Boston's  most prominent underground Dj's and promoters. Dj's such as Dave Sky,  Pat Fontes, Tari, Chuck Caseroc, Osheen, George Nessis, and Shannon  Shalako. At the same time he was supporting the local Psy Trance scene  and playing out at show's organized by Djs Dave West, Dino and Dave  Henshaw of Changmian Productions, as well as residing over a weekly at  the Phoenix Landing called Resurrection with the Blacksmith and  Helicopter Pete.<br /><br />Around the early 2000's Ammon and Nick Binary  founded Sonic Beating, a production team focused in ""larger than life""  sound design and event organizing. From there the community continued to  coalesce and the monthly event Psyforia was born. The show ran for  about 6 years at the legendary Marsh Post legion hall overlooking the  charles river. It was one of the few events in the city that was thrown  outside for the entire summer.<br /><br />During that time Ammon began  returning to his roots and found that his deep appreciation for the  House influenced style of Progressive Psy was leading him full circle  back to playing Deep/Tech House. His introduction to Boston's Burner  community allowed him to further cultivate his style at loft parties and  at Burning Man itself. He now plays and promotes a wide range of House,  Techno and Electro, performing at clubs and radio shows up and down the  east coast, as well as continuing to be involved in Psyforia as well as  the new sister show, FWD.<br /><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/ammonep"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/ammonep</a><br /><br /><br />Visuals by <strong>VJ Shmeejay</strong><br /><br /><strong>The Wonder Bar</strong><br />186 Harvard ave.

<p><strong>Split Phase</strong> (formerly <strong>Synewave</strong>) is a live electronic duo consisting of  Carl 'transient' Martin on keys and live electronics with Mike McIntosh  on acoustic/electric drums and samples. Split Phase has been hard at  work creating and developing a unique, energetic, and refreshing sound  all their own. Experimenting with influences ranging from house to drum  and bass and jazz to funk, they tap an eclectic mix of... styles to weave their sonic tapestries.<br /><br />Carl's  vast music experience spans the last 17 years. Stemming from his solo  project 'transient' (1994-2010), which includes a discography of 475+  tracks spanning more than 38 hours covering a multitude of genres.<br /><br />Over  the past 4 years Mike has established himself as a rhythmical genius  with his sticks. Honing in on his style and learning new skills along  the way while constantly challenging himself with odd timings and beats  on every track.<br /><br />With the recent release of Split Phase's new EP  titled 'Hooves Clackle', Mike and Carl have brought a reinvented and  redefined sound to the forefront, while still staying true to their  roots.<br /><br />From the beginning Split Phase has been a constantly  evolving force adapting  a do it yourself mentality in and out of the  studio, from music production, recording and mastering all of the tracks  in house. This combined with the live lighting and visual projections  by Nate VanSlyke make for a must see live music experience.<br /><br />Split  Phase's previous accomplishments include playing the 15th Annual New  York State Harvest Festival, Camp Bisco 8 &amp; 9, the Utica Music and  Arts festival, along with many other venues throughout the NorthEast.</p>

This  combination of experience and enthusiasm is firmly founded in the duo&rsquo;s  strong technical proficiency, impeccable selection of quality tracks and  their innate ability to deliver high energy and performance to seething  dance floors. <br /><br />FiG and Soappy have a combined sphere of  influence that reaches from Maine down to Pennsylvania having made  appearances at all points there and in between. They have respectively  and collaboratively been called upon to open for such leading industry  names as Adam Freeland, the Freestylers and Uberzone versus Bassbin  Twins.<br /><br />In May of 2009 Big n&rsquo; Dope released their much anticipated  self-titled debut demo mix. The mix immediately garnered much praise  from all corners of the north east scene and has since become a favorite  amongst partygoers and industry professionals alike. Now firmly  established as a force within the north east scene this forward thinking  duo is cultivating an expanding sound and evolving far beyond the  borders of their breaks base to include dubstep, drum and bass, house  and various elements of psy. Look for many upcoming Big n&rsquo; Dope  appearances in the near future showcasing this sonic evolution as well  as the follow up demo mix now in the works.

JSB's sets have been described  as ""room-shaking, hard-hitting, booty-bouncing, head-nodding cocktail of  awesomeness!""  JSB has been spinning since 2000 but has finally hit the  scene hard.  Starting in 2008 in the underground he continues to hold  down one of the best lofts boston has ever scene.  Throwing one  successful party after the next JSB is ready to bring his style of music  and parties above ground! Always known for taking ""risks"" live and  working in a lot of remixes JSB's favorite part of electronic music is  the ""what's gonna happen next?"" factor.  Breaks is the perfect genre for  him as he has embraced the challenge of combining big beat sounds from  every genre of breaks into a cohesive sound that always shocks people  and has them wondering what tracks were those, and did he do that mix  live or was it all one track?<br /><br /><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/djjsb"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/djjsb</a><br /><br />DL  : On April 13, 2002 DL signed up for a dj battle at the (now legendary)  Club Asylum in Springfield, MA. He won first place and feels that it  was the event that got ""his foot in the door."" DL found himself getting  booked more often and continued to promote himself by handing out mixes  and networking with promoters. Shortly after his win at the Asylum, DL  went on to place first in two more dj battles.<br /><br />DL continues to be  one of the fastest rising breaks djs out of New England and continues  to light floors afire with a show like no other by combining all styles  of breaks and turntablism, doing live remixes, and bringing something to  the table like no other. With DL's nasty scratching and flawless mixing  and diverse styles, a serious force to be reckoned with having played  all over New England, NYC and as far as Florida, and the West Coast.  Make sure to stay late and catch this special tag team set, and also for  a chill after hours to be announced the night of the show.<br /><br />**************************************************************<br /><br />This is all going down 1/11/11 at :<br />The Wonder Bar<br />186 Harvard ave.

<p>Music Ecology presents: The Great Mundane with Dash EXP and Adam Ridge<br /><br />The Great Mundane - Portland<br /><br />Video  game deprived and pop culturally challenged, The Great Mundane grew up  in a southeastern Michigan home where TV was made of cardboard boxes,  the tree in the backyard was his best friend and the words ""I am bored""  were household blasphemy. Aside from occasional piano lessons, he passed  time deep in his own imagination and on<br />...spontaneous  road trips, a.k.a his mother&rsquo;s famous mystery van rides, that seem to  have provoked his current state of restlessness.<br />Itching to hit the  road, The Great Mundane left his hip-hop roots in Michigan to delve into  Chicago&rsquo;s house/techno scene before arriving in the Pacific Northwest.  Now based in Portland, Oregon he takes listeners on a journey exploring  the complexities and intricacies of his minimalist and innovative  approach to beatmaking. He invents fractured, heady instrumentals laced  with lush synthesizer work that navigate the terrain of forward thinking  hip-hop and electro/house, all while exhibiting genuine emotion and  talented production skills. Each arrangement is collaged with friends,  found sounds, synthesizers, and samples meticulously programmed to  convey what it might feel like to fall in love with a tree, travel  through a wormhole, or to never be bored again.<br />His sound draws on  influences from Dabrye, Prefuse 73, Nosaj Thing, James Blake, J Dilla  and many other like-minded composers. His debut LP ""When Falls Arrive""  (psymbolic) was released in 2007 exposing him as one of the top  underground electronic musicians to keep an ear out for. Since, he has  released ""The Wires Remixes"" EP, a remix of Deru's ""Peanut Butter and  Patience"" (Mush) and his second full length entitled ""Humdrum""  (RunRiotRecords). The Great Mundane&rsquo;s music is featured on a long list  of<br />compilation albums including Portland&rsquo;s annual ""PDX Pop Now""  series. Expect remixes for SPL, Lorn, KiloWatts &amp; Bluetech as well  as a forthcoming EP entitled &ldquo;This is So You&rdquo; due in October 2010 on  1320 Records in anticipation for his next full length in May 2011 on the  same label.<br /><br /><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/the-great-mundane"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/the-great-mundane</a><br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Great-Mundane/11828203178"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Great-Mundane/11828203178</a><br /><a href=""http://www.thegreatmundane.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.thegreatmundane.com/</a><br /><br />Dash EXP (Shift Recordings/BrapDem!/Hot N Heavy/Stupid Fly) - Seattle<br /><br />Dash  EXP is an artist of connections for over a decade, in electronic dance  music (EDM) including: all things BASS.  As a DJ and producer, some of  his main influences charged to the musique concr&eacute;te movement of the  1940s and 50's, lead by Shaeffer and Stockhausen, Nine Inch Nails, early  Roni Size, American Grunge and cutting edge experimental media artists  like Gary Hill, Vito Acconci and Jack Smith.  <br />While studying  Expanded Media and Fine Arts at Alfred University in NY, he began  hosting a radio show, &ldquo;Beats, Dimes &amp; Life&rdquo; on WALF 89.7 FM.  It was  there that Dash defined himself as a cut above the rest by being the  first DJ in the station's history to mix live on air.  To this day he  continuously makes regular appearances on local and international FM and  internet broadcasts.  It was also there that he delved into noise,  ambience and rhythmic soundscape experiments (hence the EXP)-- his first  take on what would evolve into structured music in the years to come.   Refusing to slow down, Dash established the &ldquo;Kum Curek Productions&rdquo;  crew, and began to host parties to expose western New York to the  underground Jungle/D&amp;B sound.  <br />Since 2005, Dash EXP has resided  in Seattle, USA, as a BASS marauder.  Unsatisfied with the exposure  northwest ravers had to jungle music, he founded the Seattle chapter of  Konkrete Jungle, American stateside's original jungle/drum &amp; bass  dance party.  In 2006 Dash was introduced to DUBSTEP by veteran DJ,  Struggle, and shortly thereafter, made it his duty to redirect his  knowledge of experimental sounds, to create low end infused rhythms.   The year 2007 saw the completion of 'Chronicitis,' Dash EXP's first  dubstep tune, which was immediately picked up by a local start up  Seattle Record label, but soon fell under. <br />With the 2008 release of  ""Dried UP,"" a track written solely in cheap headphones at his dayjob  where he oversaw a local computer lab, Dash EXP became a household name.  'Dried UP' was then remixed by Joint Forces (a crew from down under)  and became a highly sought after club anthem, and was showcased on a  plethora of mixes, podcasts and radio shows--worldwide.  Since then,  Dash has remixed dozens of artists, and he has had a chunk of releases  on several dubstep labels including Seattle's infamous SHIFT recordings.   Ongoing production projects include remixes for underground hip hop  acts and internationally acclaimed dubstep producers, and a return to  his firstborn love; D&amp;B. In 2010, keep your ears wide for various  collaborations with vocalists and traditional musicians and be on the  look out for his debut solo EP's King of Rock, due out in early 2011, on  Brap Dem! Records. And the Soundview EP, a dive into his roots as he  explores tropical, funky kuduro vibes.  He has also completed his first  D&amp;B EP's 'Love &amp; Sex &amp; Music' and 'Chmapion Rock,'  forthcoming this winter.  <br />With his keen sense for detail and  precision during mixes, and heavy lowwend, dancers can expect sets to  stir up aurithmic bounty on the dancefloor.  With that said, rest  assured, Dash will come correct and set the mood for the dance, as he's  warmed up for heavy hitters like Micky Finn, Headhunter, R.A.W., Reid  Speed, Rusko, Dara, DJ ODI, Armin Van Buren, Empress and Darude to name a  few.  Come prepared for an arsenal of fresh material complimented by  your favorite classic basslines, as he receives support from some of the  world's leading producers and record labels around the world.  <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.soundcloud.com/dashexp"" target=""_blank"">http://www.soundcloud.com/dashexp</a><br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/DashEXP"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/DashEXP</a><br /><a href=""http://www.dashexp.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.dashexp.com/</a> <br /><br />Adam Ridge - Boston<br /><br />Dirty-dubbed disco crossed with intelligent krunk.

<p>Come  celebrate the Birthday of one of the beautiful and hard working Music  Ecology promotors and founders Polina Volchek tonight with...<br /><br />KiloWatts:<br /><br />James  Watts boasts an impressive and expansive discography of styles and  collaborations that dates back to the early 90s demoscene and has  steadily progressed forward towards making some of the most influential  electronic albums to date.  Having worked with some of the greatest  minds i...n  the industry, including Bluetech, Bil Bless, Tanner Ross, Peter Van  Ewijk, and labels Native State Records, Mothership, Dependent, and  Thoughtless Music, he has greeted the challenges in the music business  with inspired optimism, smiles, and an infectious easy going attitude.   In 2009, he played an extensive tour schedule in cities all over the US  and Canada.  In the same year we saw his 6th solo album &lsquo;Undercurrent&rsquo;,  the debut Voodeux album &lsquo;The Paranormal&rsquo;, and the 2nd KiloWatts &amp;  Vanek album &lsquo;Focus &amp; Flow&rsquo;.  It&rsquo;s fair to say the man lives and  breathes electronic music.  <br />His work embraces the bulk of electronic  genres, including breaks, IDM, techno, and downtempo.  His albums on  Artificial Music Machine that are full of visionary dimensions, fusing  together a dexterous knowledge of sound synthesis, deep emotional  articulation, and solid melodic intuition. Peppered throughout these  monumental statements are releases with class labels such as Somnia,  Thoughtless Music, and his own outlet, KiloWatts Music, that celebrate  his adept technical expertise, often bringing a whirlwind of digital  wizardry in the form of glitches and edits.  The list of projects and  collaborations continues to grow, but some of the highlights are:   Skeetaz, with breakbeat cohort Bil Bless brings hard-hitting digital  glitched-out psychedelic funk. His collaboration with singer Peter Van  Ewijk is a mystical ride with vocals and guitar, nested atop edgy  electronica. With Tanner Ross, an eerie style of dark techno is born  under the name Voodeux for Dirtybird&rsquo;s techno sublabel Mothership.  Fellow Philadelphian MC Amagine delivers consciousness-driven motifs in  their digital glitch-hop project called Super Galactic Expansive.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.kilowattsmusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.kilowattsmusic.com/</a><br /><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/kilowatts"" target=""_blank"">http://www.myspace.com/kilowatts</a><br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/KiloWatts/104988830570"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/pages/KiloWatts/104988830570</a><br /><br /><br />dj steppo ( lovewavemusic/bassic, boston) <br />With  over ten years experience in the game, and a serious love for all  things music, DJ Steppo has rocked crowds from New England to Miami and  San Francisco, and has played along such acts as Pinch, Joe Nice,  Pendulum, Adam F, Mayhem, Reid Speed and many more.

<p>Music Ecology presents: Winter Solstice celebration w/ Cathode Rays, Lenore, MTN and much more...<br /><br />This will be an epic event and I'll tell you why...<br /><br />Tuesday,  December 21st, 2010 is the Winter Solstice, marking the perihelion,  where the orbit of a planetary body is closest to the Sun, and in this  case, the Earth is closest to the sun.  This has astrological and  cultural significance unto itself but it just so happens that on that ...same  night, there is a full moon (8:15pm) and a Total Lunar Eclipse  occurring,  This is ***NO BULLSHIT*** A once in a lifetime opportunity  to be a part of.  The next time that this alignment occurs is a long  time from now (60+ years).  The energy of the evening will be very  pulling, emotional, vibrant, loving (or not), but all in all, it is  going to be a very special event and my understanding is that this  alignment will not happen again in our lifetime so get it while ya can!

<p>Music Ecology is proud to present another night of all original live EDM, this week with:<br /><br />Lespecial (Live Band / <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/lespecial"" target=""_blank"">http://www.myspace.com/lespecial</a>)<br />Lespecial's  sound was once described as a bus carrying Les Claypool's band crashing  into J-Dilla's studio, and others have pulled names like Radiohead and  Medeski Martin and Wood in an attempt to pin down this trio's unique  sound. No matter which of their myriad influences you choose to...  compare them too, the unavoidable fact is that lespecial is  attempting... to tap into a raw and primitive rhythmic interlock to  create a universally accesible groove that gets people on their feet and  into the street.<br />lespecial has played a heroic amount of live shows  given their young age, and have shared the stage with acts like Bob  Marley's the Wailers, Dead Prez, George Clinton, RAQ, Fishbone, the  Breakfast, the Wood Brothers, Hot Buttered Rum, Max Creek, Ryan  Montbleau, and even performed with members of Medeski Martin and Wood  and the Yeah Yeah Yeahs.<br /><br />ELECTRONICAnonymous (Jules of Higher Organix / <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/electronicanonymous"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/electronicanonymous</a>)<br />ELECTRONICAnonymous  is the EDM brain-child of Jules Jenssen. 1/3 of underground  dance-fusion power trio HiGHER ORGANiX , Jules has been playing music  since he was 8 years old, first dabbling in piano, then embracing the  drums as his musical voice. Heavily rooted in traditional band style  rock music, (Floyd, Hendrix, Zeppelin, Phish, all his father's bands,  etc..) Jules found electronic music as a pre-teen and immediately was  drawn to carefully sculpted, evolving beats, throbbing bass, and  euphoric synthetic sound design. Although he didn't start making  electronic music for years, he continued to integrate the theory into  his drumming and live band. In the summer of 2008, Jules dove head first  into the world of EDM production and nocturnal sleep cycles, making  everything from electro-house, to dubstep, to krunk - -&amp; styles  yet-unnamed. Having already shared the stage with OTT, Sub Swara,  Bluetech, Dub War NYC and Psylab, to name a few, the anonymous might not  be unknown for long...<br /><br />MetalKT (Vermin Street / <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/metalkt"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/metalkt</a>)<br />MetalKT  is an electronic music producer, programmer, composer, DJ and sound  designer based in Boston, MA. An infusion of subtle ambient modality and  powerful beat-driven energy, her compositions express spiritual  tranquility with vibrant intensity. Today her style is still highly  influenced by her background as a classical music enthusiast and shred  metal guitar player (hence the nickname). Several of her all-original  compositions have been featured on compilation CDs, including releases  by Vermin Street and Berklee College of Music. <br /><br />10 PM, 21+, $5<br /><br />Visuals by VJ Shmeejay<br /><br />For this and future events visit<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology</a><br /><a href=""http://www.musicecologyboston.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.musicecologyboston.com/</a><br /><br />Promotional assistance by<br /><br />Forbidden Bass Crew<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790</a><br /><br />LostinSound Crew<br /><a href=""http://www.lostinsound.org/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lostinsound.org/</a></p>","\N","2010-12-11 21:08:32+00","2010-12-11 21:08:32+00","1","2010-12-09 14:37:42+00","t","f","174041665951379"

<p>In  1999, R/D and his former DJ partner were invited to help throw a  party  for the closing of Perry Farrell&rsquo;s studio in Venice Beach, CA.  They  DJ&rsquo;d for 6 hours, breaking only once for a debut of Perry&rsquo;s new solo  project.  Several month&rsquo;s later, R/D was invited to DJ in the Oasis dome  at the very first Coachella music festival.  These monumental events  drew him straight to Los Angeles and the rest, as they say, is history.   He w...ent  on to throw scores of parties in L.A., Dj&rsquo;ing alongside Plaid,  Squarepusher, Prefuse 73, Dntel, Jaimie Lidell, Luke Vibert, Nightmares  on Wax, LFO, Chris Clark, and many other electronic acts of the early  &rsquo;00&rsquo;s.<br />Eventually R/D started making his own music on borrowed gear,  hammering out glitched up IDM and electro on an MPC 2000. Luckily, the  first tracks he ever wrote were later released on Andrea Parker&rsquo;s UK  label &lsquo;Touchin&rsquo; Bass&lsquo;.  As the era of Aphex Twin influenced IDM came to  an end, R/D virtually hung up his hat, turning to film sound as a  creative outlet. But, his musical nature was re-invigorated in 2007 when  he moved in with pals edIT and Ooah, just as the Glitch Mob sound was  forming. Feeding off the fresh energy of his incredibly talented  roommates, he went back to the drawing board, developing his take on  glitch-hop inspired tunes aimed at the dancefloor. His new sound fetched  him gigs at Coachella with the Do Lab in 2007 and 2009, and put him on  the West Coast festival circuit where he shared bills with Flying Lotus,  Pretty Lights, Bassnectar, The Glitch Mob, Les Claypool, Cocoe Rosie,  Caspa, Mala, Beats Antique, Mimosa, MartyParty and a laundry list of  incredible talent.<br />Recently, R/D has traded the bleeps and bloops of  glitch-hop for pure melody and song structure, and as his music matures,  so does his career. In March of 2010, R/D unleashed an un-official  remix of Fever Ray&rsquo;s &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Not Done&rsquo;, which reached #2 on both Hype  Machine charts and reaped 27,000 listens in 3 days on SoundCloud alone.  Several months later, he released an original, four track EP titled  'Face Of God'; the title track again landed him in the top #3 on Hype  Machine's Twitter charts. So far this year, he has played live for a  crowd of more than 2,000 at Coachella 2010 (the Do Lab stage), shared  the stage with Nosaj Thing &amp; Elliot Lipp at Lightning in a Bottle  festival and played directly after Bassnectar for a crowd of nearly  5,000 dusty ravers at this year's Burning Man festival.<br />Currrently,  R/D is working on an official Glitch Mob remix as well as a remix for  Ball Of Waxx records, both due for release in September of this year.  He's also cranking hard on a new, full-length album, due in early 2011.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.rd-sound.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.rd-sound.com/</a><br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/RDmusic"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/RDmusic</a><br /><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/rd"" target=""_blank"">http://www.myspace.com/rd</a><br /><a href=""http://www.twitter.com/_RD"" target=""_blank"">http://www.twitter.com/_RD</a><br /><a href=""http://www.soundcloud.com/r-d-1"" target=""_blank"">http://www.soundcloud.com/r-d-1</a><br /><a href=""http://www.rdmusic.bandcamp.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.rdmusic.bandcamp.com/</a> <br /><br />Support by <br /><br />Stickem (Titched Records / Lost in Bass / Circle) <br /><br />and<br /><br />Professorpious (Music Ecology / Lost in Bass / SMGU)<br /><br /><br />Tonight  we sadly say farewell to Stickem in his final Boston public appearance  before he heads to San Francisco.

Stickem has performed at festivals and  skweee marathons throughout Europe alongside Eero Johannes, Beem, Daniel  Savio, Mesak, Pavan, and many others.<br /><br />Stickem has also been a  fixture in the Boston electronic music scene since 2005 representing  Circle, Lost in Bass, and glitch.fm.

Over the past three  years, El Mongoose &amp; Bevvy Swift AKA Glitchy &amp; Scratchy have  single-handedly broken the &ldquo;glit...ch  hop&rdquo; sound in their hometown of Vancouver, BC, longside their  ever-growing posse of bass and glitch heads. Known as the &ldquo;Integrated  Grime Unit&rdquo; (a collective which counts among its ranks  Glitchhopforum.com head honcho Dewey dB, as well as bass prodigies  Ill-Esha, Jay Wikid, and JmeJ), they promote and help shape the face of  underground music in their city. No strangers to swarms of sweaty, happy  people, Glitchy &amp; Scratchy's music maintains a dancefloor  sensibility often forgotten in a world of tweaked wobbles and  schizophrenic edits. <br /><br /><a href=""http://www.woofercookers.com/mixes/Glitchy&amp;Scratchy-The_Weather_Report.mp3"" target=""_blank"">http://www.woofercookers.com/mixes/Glitchy&amp;Scratchy-The_Weather_Report.mp3</a><br /><br /><a href=""http://www.mutimusic.com/2/news/releases/muti056-glitchy-scratchy-broken-logic-ep/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.mutimusic.com/2/news/releases/muti056-glitchy-scratchy-broken-logic-ep/</a><br /><br />---------------------------------------------------<br />With support from: <br /><br />Eelko - Boston, MA <br /><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/eelko"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/eelko</a><br /><br />Live Electronics! <br /><br /><br />Professorpious - (Music Ecology, Lost In Bass, Glitch.FM,) <br /><br />Music  Ecology resident Professorpious will be closing out the night.

<p>Music Ecology is proud to present another night of all original EDM, this week from:<br /><br />Lady Sasquatch (Figgy's live band - <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/ladysasquatchmusic"" target=""_blank"">http://www.myspace.com/ladysasquatchmusic</a>)<br /><br />Lady  Sasquatch sets the stage for an all-inclusive audio/visual experience.  Their music consists of a variety of glitched out heavy weighted hip hop  beats, electronic soundscapes laced with organic spirit and a mix of  rhymes and melodic grit smuggled from the demented m...inds  of their frontline. Using samples, synths, guitars, live percussion and  deep bass, they seduce the audience to an apex of primal kinetic  explosion. Along with an extensive catalog of originals, Lady Sas sets  are known to include unexpected mash-ups and intoxicating live remixes.<br /><br />Blue Boy Productions (Music Ecology, <a href=""http://blueboyproductions.net/"" target=""_blank"">http://blueboyproductions.net/</a>)<br /><br />BBP  is an audiovisual project specializing in intense bass heavy dance  music that spans the genres of EDM, blending live instruments with  samples and original productions in a way that allows for real  improvisation and unrehearsed moments of creativity and spontaneity.<br /><br />Since  their live debut in April 2009 BBP has played shows with Ott, Bluetech,  Heyoka, Mount Kimbie, Jazzsteppa, Eskmo, RAQ, Telepath, Pnuma Trio, Big  Gigantic, Marco Benevento Trio, Eliot Lipp, Psylab, Biodiesel, Jeff  Bujak, Zebbler Encanti Experience, Afro Monk, Superfiction, The  Hippocampus, Joe Nice, and many more, as well as delivering memorable  late night sets at underground afterparties for acts like STS9, The  Disco Biscuits and Shpongle.<br /><br /><br />Perileyes (<a href=""http://soundcloud.com/perileyes"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/perileyes</a>)<br /><br />Beginning  as the brainchild of Sheridan Willard in 2001, perileyes has grown to  be an anomaly of sorts. After Liam Collins' joining in 2009, the duo has  yielded ""Groovy intense dubstep clashing with elements of industrial in  a Shpongle-esque swirl of psychedelia."" With their unique take on  dubstep, perileyes promises to be an act to follow in the year to come.<br /><br />$5, 21+, 10 PM<br /><br />Photography by Hamza Daoui<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hamza-Daoui-Photography/108316815877968"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hamza-Daoui-Photography/108316815877968</a><br /><br />Promotional assistance provided by Forbidden Bass Crew<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790</a><br /><br />and Lostinsound Crew<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/LostinSoundorg"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/LostinSoundorg</a></p>","\N","2010-10-12 23:33:39+00","2010-10-22 11:04:30+00","1","2010-10-07 17:49:43+00","t","f","110192885712028"

<p>This  week Music Ecology is excited to welcome Moldy out of Portland, ME.  With support from Bassic veteran and dope beat maker Dabu (<a href=""http://soundcloud.com/ghttoblstr"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/ghttoblstr</a>) as well as local dubstep producer Prism (<a href=""http://soundcloud.com/prismdub"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/prismdub</a>).<br /><br />I think this Dub War podcast of all original Moldy tracks pretty much speaks for itself: <br /><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/moldy/dub-war-podcast-12-moldy"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/moldy/dub-war-podcast-12-moldy</a><br /><br />...but here's some more info about Moldy:<br /><br />A  native of Portland, ME and seasoned inhabitant of Boston, MA and New  York, NY, the &ldquo;New England sub assassin&rdquo; and &ldquo;New York City dubstep  pioneer&rdquo; (thekronicle.com, 3/3/10) is known far and wide for his  mind-bending DJ sets and deep, dark, thoughtful bass music productions. A  &ldquo;veteran of American dubstep&rdquo; (flavorwire.com, 4/19/10), Moldy has been  at the forefront of the US dubstep movement since its inception,  sharing the stage with bass music innovators including The Bomb Squad,  Skream, Plastician, Mala, Loefah, Pinch, Distance, Starkey, N-Type,  Breakage, Digital, Dara, Dieselboy, Headhunter, Joe Nice and Dave Q.<br /><br />Dabu (Bassic/SMGU)<br /><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/ghttoblstr"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/ghttoblstr</a><br /><br />Prism (<a href=""http://soundcloud.com/prismdub"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/prismdub</a>)<br /><br />Prism  studied under Vance Gordan [Dicenso's Drum Shop/First Class Band]  specializing in Afro Cuban rhythms and the Moeller technique prior to  venturing into music production. Being fortunate enough to have a close  friend with a Roland MV8800 and a father with an endless collection of  rare vinyl gave birth to PRISM's first endeavour into music production.  ""OMEGA"" represented a vast and eclectic style of sample based  instrumental Hip Hop defined by his lifetime observation of music such  as: Pat Metheny, Goldie, Mahavishnu Orchestra, BT, Fonky Family, Sizzla,  J Dilla, Chinese Contemporary Classical Music, The Prodigy, Cultura  Profetica, Buena Vista Social Club, Fear Factory, Chick Corea, Orbital  and many more that inspired him to persue music originally. After  studying many Buddhist texts, World Philosophies, Native American  rituals, listening to artists such as Heny G, Mala, H.O.D, Loefah,  Synkro, Silkie and Quest and becoming more and more intrigued by the  intricate likeness of all societies, cultures and religions, PRISM was  created with a deeper purpose, not only to showcase all of these  influences but to convey an awareness that all things, no matter how  different they may appear in physical form, are all the same.<br /><br />$5, 21+, 10 PM<br /><br />Photography by Hamza Daoui<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hamza-Daoui-Photography/108316815877968"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/pages/Hamza-Daoui-Photography/108316815877968</a><br /><br />Promotional assistance provided by Forbidden Bass Crew<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=365770374790</a><br /><br />and Lostinsound Crew<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/LostinSoundorg"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/LostinSoundorg</a></p>","\N","2010-10-14 13:59:28+00","2010-10-15 18:31:07+00","1","2010-10-12 23:34:16+00","t","f","121010021288404"

<p>VibeSquaD, aka Aaron Holstein, is Colorado&rsquo;s most beloved bass music producer/performer/innovator.  His trained musical background contribute to his unique take on bass  music, which carries him around the country playing packed clubs coast  to coast.... Since  VibeSquaD&rsquo;s inception in 2007, he has released three full-length  albums, two previous EP&rsquo;s, as well as remixes and singles for  Interchill, Multi Music and Proboscis. The New Creatures EP is his next  release, showcasing his top-notch production skills and originality over  the course of six tracks. The EP is charged with the energy and  positivity that has come to define VibeSquaD&rsquo;s signature sound and  vibrant stage persona. In addition to his deep electronic  production abilities, New Creatures shows the influence Aaron&rsquo;s twenty  plus years experience playing live music in various touring groups has  on his sound. As a trained multi instrumentalist with a jazz background,  VibeSquaD adds melodic sensibility to these gems of bass music and  truly delivers on in this six-track EP. Equipped with tweaked vocal  samples, polyrhythmic textures, and trunk rattling bass, these tracks  grab hold and refuse to let go. Swirling, soaring synth textures weave  throughout hard-hitting drum patterns on top of crushing bass thick  enough to send any dance floor into a frenzy.</p>

He also performed  as a sideman, with many notable acts including NYC based DJ Logic and  the internationally renown Devotchka.<br /><br />D.V.S* is a very prolific  beatsmith, even by today's fast paced electronica standards. Since  October 2009, he has released a full length CD, 2 EP's, an all original  mixtape, and 2 singles. All releases are available at dvsmusic.net. In  early 2009 he won the JFJO remix contest for their tune ""Tetherball,""  which was released on 1320 records.<br /><br />PRESS<br />&bull; &ldquo;D.V.S* combines  beautiful melodies, super fat beats, and jazz guitar power.

At a young age, Jon was given a guitar by a  neighbor. Soon afterward, he stumbled upon a broken amp, took it apart  and put it back together into working condition. Having an incredible  ear for music, he was able to pick out the notes he heard, and play  along with any song. Over the years, he's played in different rock  bands, including the popular local New Hampshire bands; Something and  Mantra. While being influenced by different genres of rock, he was also  becoming deeply integrated into the electronica scene, and of course  with a healthy serving of hip hop and rap on the side. Soon he had a  keyboard and was experimenting with making music of his own, with  psychedelic melodies and hypnotic tones, empowered with heavy  instrumentals. He has now been producing a dance oriented, groove  inspired, glitchy style of music that is energetic, passionate and fun.  Of course, infusing his positive vibrations and inspiring light baked  into every morsel of each tantalizing song. The concoction of organic  sounds whipped and blended with original bass lines and drum patterns,  along with his ability to manipulate the texture and flavor of each  synthesized note will leave the listener delighted in savoring every  delicious layer baked into every song.<br /><br /><br />Krallspace<br /><br />Krallspace  (Alex Rivera Krall) knows a hot beat when he hears one. ""Up and coming""  in the Boston electronica/dub-hop scene, Alex has been serving heads  with a wide array of dirty dubbed out glitchy rhythms as well a brand of  breakbeat and hip-hop that is guaranteed to send a dancefloor into a  frenzy. Residing in Boston, Massachusetts, Alex has been featured  alongside a list of notable acts such as EOTO, Vibesquad, Alex B (of  Pnuma Trio), Eliot Lipp, Two Fresh, Signal Path, and Virtual Boy over  the course of the past few years. This summer, Krallspace has been  working on his debut EP ""Playing With Fire"" that he will deliver to the  hands of the public as a free download with an expected release in early  November.</p>","\N","2010-09-30 19:12:48+00","2010-10-03 02:27:34+00","1","2010-09-08 20:14:28+00","t","f","148997448471720"

<p><strong>Heyoka</strong> AKA Andrei Olenev is a cosmic auditory scientist found  in the Bay Area noosphere, who has been blowing minds with his sonic  manipulations.<br />Muti Music first released Heyoka&rsquo;s &ldquo;Space Case EP&rdquo; in  2008 and included him on their growing roster of talented artists. His  albums &lsquo;Whomp Gland &amp; Pineal Dub&rsquo;, &lsquo;Gate Code&rsquo; and the all new  &lsquo;Marklar&rsquo; album in 2010 have shown that he is a producer consistently ...evolving his musical style while managing to maintain a signature sound that is distinctively &lsquo;Heyoka&rsquo;.<br />His  early influences in Downtempo, Dub and IDM combined with midtempo  dancefloor genres have helped create a very unique sound that combines  relentless basslines, hip hop rhythms, dub vibes, and musicality and  melody, all within an atmosphere of heavy psychedelia and alien  dimensions. The response to his emergence so far has been overwhelming  with Heyoka developing audiences and playing festivals from US to Canada  and Australia. <br /><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/andreism"" target=""_blank"">www.myspace.com/andreism</a><br /><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/heyoka-1"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/heyoka-1</a><br /><a href=""http://www.heyokamusic.com/"" target=""_blank"">www.heyokamusic.com</a></p>

Eliciting emotions that range from respect to disgust to adoration, the fruit has earned the nickname, """"King of Fruits,"""" and has been banned in many hotels and public areas due to its smell. No doubt this brash fruit is an appropriate namesake for the Brooklyn live Electronic/IDM/Dubstep band, Durians. The trio's powerful presence and sound are as impressive and unique as the fruit's funky odor.<br /><br />""""...This is live-instrument electronic music on steroids, featuring dance-inducing break-beats and drum and bass amongst a psychedelic swirl of sonic delights."""" - Ed Dufresne, Montpelier Times Argus, 8/28/09<br /><br />Although the group uses recognizable elements from the newest DJ-dominated Electronic Dance Music genres, Durians never sticks to formulas. Dubstep bass lines played from Nick Kirshnit's hybrid bass are so dirty, aggressive and low that they defy standards of the genre. Drum n' bass and jazz-infused trip hop beats are pounded so hard by drummer Ryan Ramirez that they compel even the most reserved concert-goers to move their feet. Melodies and sounds from Gnome Chalmsky's trombone and keyboards are so twisted that they take each song into a different epic dimension. <br /><br />"""" ...like Aphex twin and Squarepusher but they take it to the next level..."""" - DJ Lovelace, Brooklyn Radio, (Nov 12, 2010)<br /><br />The idea began with longtime musical cohorts Kirshnit and Chalmsky in Burlington, VT. They had been engrossed by the work of such artists as Amon Tobin, Squarepusher and Jo-Jo Mayer's Nerve, and the influence that these artists had on Kirshnit and Chalmsky was large and obvious. The success of the project eventually compelled them to move to New York City, where they met drummer Ryan Ramirez, a recent transplant from North Carolina. Ramirez, an already accomplished session drummer with Soul/Funk ensembles, had been inspired by Electronica drummers such as Adam Deitch, Jo-Jo Mayer and KJ Sawka. He, Kirshnit and Chalmsky clicked and immediately began work on releasing their music.<br /><br />After releasing their EP, """"Adrenochrome Gnome,"""" Durians have been growing in notoriety in the North-East. They find themselves at home in a variety of scenes, from EDM, to IDM, to Jamtronica, even picking up fans of jazz and heavy metal.""</strong></p>

<p>PARTYBOOBYTRAP - Virtue, Exquisite Corpse and DJ Emoh are rewriting the rules of hip-hop. Known collectively as partyboobytrap, the three artists are anything but an ordinary hip-hop tandem. Virtue and Exquisite Corpse intricately observe the world around them and are quick to point out its flaws and quirks. Displacing traditional hip-hop clich&eacute;s with layers of internal rhymes and witty, biting realizations, partyboobytrap speaks to a generation of people cast aside by mainstream society.<br /><br />Download/stream album for free here:<br /><a href=""http://entrapment.bandcamp.com/album/entrapment-coverone"" target=""_blank"">http://entrapment.bandcamp.com/album/entrapment-coverone</a><br /><br />EJ3 ROBOT- EJ3 robot is a musical aficionado of sorts, who uses keyboards, guitars, samples and looping devices to produce unique bends of funk, trip hop, jazz, blues, trance and jam rock, while also invading and meshing other genres of electronic music .

<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.8778520496562123"">Jeff Bujak is a Northampton, MA based keyboardist/producer/composer who has designed a new style of intelligent dance music (IDM) that dives deep into the waters of complex electronica and he's carving a fresh path in the live-music scene one performance at a time. Though, if you ask a Jeff Bujak fan to describe his music, a blank face followed by a smile would prove to be a common trial answer, then usually words like 'dirty' and 'epic' start pouring out. His music falls into a large pool of electronica dance genres, lands on one and leaps to the next while he wails away on his keyboards to create something truly moving, smart and original.<br /><br />Bujak began his history with the piano at age 7. He started studying music theory a couple years later and began understanding the math of music. Since then, he has written over 300-solo compositions ranging from standard classical styles to extravagant heavy metal fury. He looks for what's been done before and finds a way to recreate the theory with dance music in a way that hasn't been heard, yet strangely familiar at the same time. He handcrafts his own hard-driving beats and loops, then samples and performs his half improv/ half composed pieces live to create an experience clearly pushed into it's own category.<br /><br />Jeff Bujak tours live full-time with 4-studio albums, over 120-multitrack live-albums under his belt and enough keyboard/ gadget wizardry and sequencing know-how to hold the energy in a raging audience for over 4-hours straight. Whether it's the two 4 &frac12; hour non-stop sets on Jam Cruise earlier this year or the countless set-break sets from last year for The New Deal, Lotus and Eoto, Bujak is perfoming memorable sets and quickly becoming one of the most talked about solo acts on the road.<br /><a href=""http://www.jeffbujak.com/"">http://www.jeffbujak.com</a>&nbsp;<br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/jeffbujak"">http://www.youtube.com/jeffbujak</a>&nbsp;<br /><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jeffbujakmusic"">https://www.facebook.com/jeffbujakmusic</a>&nbsp;<br /><br /><br />10 PM, $5, 21+<br /><br /><br />Wonder Bar<br />186 Harvard Avenue in Allston<br />""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green line B<br /><br />Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

<p>Cathode Rays is a Boston-based chiptune rock band which consists of Rob Lynch, Avi Paul Weinstein, and Kedaar Kumar. Rob started the project as a solo 8-bit programmer and performs live using a Super Nintendo controller to play 8-bit melodies. Avi joined the group when Rob started adding guitar to his compositions. During the summer of 2009, they played shows with Oxytocin, a collective formed at Harmonix Music with multiple artists from diverse musical backgrounds. After playing shows throughout the fall with Boston8bit, a New England chiptune collective, the group expanded to a 3-piece with Kedaar on drums. Their unique blend of 8-bit sounds, live instrumentation, and custom visuals gives them a style unlike any.</p>

Through the influential record shop Pelikan Neck he picked up on the early forms of dubstep and began focusing his productions on bass heavy garage influenced tracks. This led to his first release as ""forensix (mcr)"" on Revolution music in 2006 with one of his first productions.<br /><br />After the release of his first record, he took a break to tighten up his production. He came back in 2009 as xxxy which led to the releases of ""Reflections ep"" on the influential Manchester label Mindset and ""Science Fiction/651"" on Formant Recordings. By late 2009 he had begun to become more and more influenced by house music which had begun to take up a much larger section of his record collection.<br /><br />2010 saw the release of a split of the very well received 12"" on Infrasonics. Comprised of the Baltimore influenced ""Blue Flashing Lights"" and the Funky Roller ""Know You"" which was included in FACT magazine's tunes of 2010 list.<br /><br />Later in 2010 he released the critically acclaimed garage influenced ep ""Every Step Forward"" on Fortified Audio.<br /><br />The January 2011 release of ""You Always Start it/Ordinary Things"" on Ten Thousand Yen increased xxxy's burgeoning reputation with Pitchfork picking ""ordinary things"" as it's best new tune of the day ""What's so special about ""Ordinary Things"" isn't its parts, though, but how impeccably they are put together...This rush comes complete with a joyous ""Whoo!"" sample to let you know that, yeah, while you're getting the chills, this is still body-moving music.""<br /><br />2011 will see releases on Orca, Well Rounded, Infrasonics &amp; All City together with Remixes for Tri Angle and the Count &amp; Sinden.<br /><br />As a DJ xxxy has produced well received mixes for FACT, BBQ &amp; URB as well as playing dates all over the UK and Europe.<br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F9715&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><a href=""http://triplexy.co.uk/"">http://triplexy.co.uk/</a> <br /><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/triplexy"">https://www.facebook.com/triplexy</a> <br /><br />Jaminic<br />""Over the past few years, Boston based DJ/Producer Jaminic has been playing under his main project N.E.

He started his music career spinning records and soon became immersed in more technology like CDJs and midi controllers. Influenced by artists such as Orchard Lounge, Dirty Bird Records, James Zabiela, and Modeselektor, Jaminic's deep bass and melodic house beats create a feel-good Tropical atmosphere, where everyone wants to be. Currently a student, he has taken classes at the New England Institute of Art for Audio Production, such as Audio Technology--where he studied waveforms and frequencies, and Audio Recording, in which he recorded and edited a band in the studio. He is also largely self-taught though countless hours in the studio working on original production. <br />Jaminic started playing at local parties and clubs in Massachusetts including Goodlife, Middlesex, Phoenix Landing, Rise, and Umbria. He soon went on to play to bigger crowds at venues like Santos Party House in New York City, Lupo's and Therapy in Road Island, Curve Ultra Lounge in Maine, and Castaway's in New York State. Jaminic has played with some of the hottest artists including Nasty Nasty, Big Gigantic, Benga, Steve Porter, Zeds Dead, Orchard Lounge, Clockwork, Nightriders, Alex B, Two Fresh, Beats Antique BioDiesel, EOTO, Nit Grit, Sub Swara, Walter Jones and last but certainly not least Chas Bronz. He has affiliations with groups such as The Brain Trust, Mass EDMC, True Crew, and CreateSpace Collab (CSC). Ranging threw all genres of electronica Jaminic's main style of sound is tropical bass, as it has many natural elements of global island vocals and crunchy bass lines.

Ames Henry can never be boxed in by one style or sound as he is always trying to explore the emotional nuances carried by each genre. His latest collection of beats can be described as driven, eccentric, and cinematic. Ames Henry hopes to explore outside the West Coast beat driven scene, taking cues from Detroit techno and give Seattle its own character of electronic music as LA, Detroit, Chicago, and New York have done.

House music is a a way of life. <br />Born at the end of the disco era in the late 70's NiteKrawla a.k.a. Anthony E was brought up during the birth of house music in the 80's; however, he would not be introduced to this new style of music until his teen years in the early to mid 90's. Once introduced, he realized this new and fresh style of music would put a grip on him that would develop into a passio. Frustrated by the lack of originality in the mainstream and influenced by this new style of music he began djing as an outlet for self expression in his teen years long before ever being able to step foot in a nightclub. He experienced the scene first hand by the end of his teen years and into his 20's and he found himself throwing ""mainstream"" music and its remixes out the window and playing underground grooves exclusively. Now into his early 30's and djing for more than half of his life he still continues to play hard edgy underground grooves that control dance floors. <br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F563403&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe> <br /><br />Professorpious<br />Professorpious has been hooked on electronic music since the late nineties where he was drawn to the frenetic sounds of DnB as a young man.

<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.020970648387447"">Jeff Bujak<br />Jeff Bujak is a Northampton, MA based keyboardist/producer/composer who has designed a new style of intelligent dance music (IDM) that dives deep into the waters of complex electronica and he's carving a fresh path in the live-music scene one performance at a time. Though, if you ask a Jeff Bujak fan to describe his music, a blank face followed by a smile would prove to be a common trial answer, then usually words like 'dirty' and 'epic' start pouring out. His music falls into a large pool of electronica dance genres, lands on one and leaps to the next while he wails away on his keyboards to create something truly moving, smart and original.<br /><br />Bujak began his history with the piano at age 7. He started studying music theory a couple years later and began understanding the math of music. Since then, he has written over 300-solo compositions ranging from standard classical styles to extravagant heavy metal fury. He looks for what's been done before and finds a way to recreate the theory with dance music in a way that hasn't been heard, yet strangely familiar at the same time. He handcrafts his own hard-driving beats and loops, then samples and performs his half improv/ half composed pieces live to create an experience clearly pushed into it's own category.<br /><br />Jeff Bujak tours live full-time with 4-studio albums, over 120-multitrack live-albums under his belt and enough keyboard/ gadget wizardry and sequencing know-how to hold the energy in a raging audience for over 4-hours straight. Whether it's the two 4 &frac12; hour non-stop sets on Jam Cruise earlier this year or the countless set-break sets from last year for The New Deal, Lotus and Eoto, Bujak is performing memorable sets and quickly becoming one of the most talked about solo acts on the road.<br /><a href=""http://www.jeffbujak.com/"">http://www.jeffbujak.com</a> <br /><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/jeffbujak"">http://www.youtube.com/jeffbujak</a> <br /><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/jeffbujakmusic"">https://www.facebook.com/jeffbujakmusic</a><br /><br />Wonder Bar<br />186 Harvard Avenue, Allston<br />""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green Line B<br /><br />10 PM - 2 AM, 21+, $5<br /><br />Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

Producing with a computer since 1996, he's honed an original style that's defined by complex breakbeats, deep analog basslines, techno-flavored synths, organic instrumentation and contorted samples.<br /><br />CacheFlowe's live show is a fast-paced smorgasbord of chopped breakbeats and analog synths on 8 channels of audio. He bobs and weaves through an array of electronic genres and tempos, using nothing but sounds and loops from his own productions. A CacheFlowe DJ set is something entirely different, ranging from booty-shaking futuristic dance music to heady downtempo beats, depending on the situation and the crowd. Having recently added original audio-reactive visual projections to his audio performance, he quickly received the """"Best Audio/Visual Performer"""" award from Denver's esteemed Westword magazine.<br /><br />Appearing on official releases alongside the likes of Daedelus, Starkey, Ladytron, Ulrich Schnauss, Mochipet, Twine, Machinedrum, ISAN, Chrissy Murderbot and Brer Rabbit of the Flobots, and sharing the stage with Amon Tobin, Solvent, edIT, Machinedrum, Dizzee Rascal, Rusko, Jeff Parker (Tortoise), DJ Olive (MMW, Sonic Youth), Nels Cline (Wilco) and countless local talents, CacheFlowe has carved out a unique niche as a shape-shifting multimedia artist. <br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F297149&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><a href=""http://www.cacheflowe.com/"">http://www.cacheflowe.com</a> <br /><a href=""http://www.progressvideo.tv/"">http://www.progressvideo.tv</a> <br /><a href=""http://www.justinefekt.com/"">http://www.justinefekt.com</a> <br /><a href=""http://www.plasticsoundsupply.com/"">http://www.plasticsoundsupply.com</a> <br /><a href=""http://justin30.tumblr.com/"">http://justin30.tumblr.com/</a> <br /><a href=""http://www.coloradoexperimental.org/"">http://www.coloradoexperimental.org</a> <br /><br /><br /> 10 PM, $5, 21+<br /> <br />Wonder Bar<br />186 Harvard Avenue in Allston<br />""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green line B<br /><br />Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.6987626501359046"">Filastine<br />""Grey Filastine is a producer/musician based in Barcelona, but more often found traveling with his nomadic&nbsp;studio: studying trance rhythms in Morocco, recording rappers in Indonesia, and gathering street noise&nbsp;from everywhere to compose a dense transnational bass music. It's a sound that collides the deepest&nbsp;frequencies of dubstep with syncopated beat science, acoustic instruments and voices of many tongues.&nbsp;<br />Best known for his hectic live performances, Filastine triggers riddims and synchronized video from a heap of electronics and an amplified shopping cart, expertly fusing digital elements with live percussion.&nbsp;From a hip-hop concert in Borneo to a soccer stadium in Casablanca, from a car-mounted guerrilla soundsystem to a junk raft floating down the Mississippi, he has played in every type of venue imaginable,&nbsp;with prominent billing at festivals such as Sonar (ES), Transmediale (DE), Shambhala (CA) and Sydney&nbsp;Fest (AU). Performances often feature guest cellist Am&eacute;lie Bouard or vocalist Nova Ruth Setyaningtyas.<br />Filastine recently dropped his second album Dirty Bomb (2009), a gritty soundclash recorded in 16 cities&nbsp;with 15 collaborators. ""Awesome and delicate... hybrids so fluent they defy classification""&nbsp;-Pitchfork, ""the prototype of globalized urban sound... It will devastate your subwoofer"" -Prefix Mag. Like&nbsp;the music itself, its distribution is rhizomic and decentralized; the album was released simultaneously on&nbsp;four regional indie labels: Jarring Effects (France/EU), Romz (Japan), Soot (Americas/UK), Uber Lingua&nbsp;(Oceania). Dirty Bomb hit with a hundred-date tour, three music videos, and heavy radio play- charting at&nbsp;#4 on the French Feraliste, #7 on CMJ's RPM in North America.<br />Filastine first went public in 2006 with the album Burn It on DJ Rupture's boutique imprint Soot Records.&nbsp;""Filled with both jagged edges and moments of sad sweetness... Burn It is sure to win fans across&nbsp;multiple scenes"" -XLR8R. Next came a pair of dj mixes, The Mud, Blood, &amp; the Beer: a&nbsp;Fistfight with the Near East (CD,Tigerbeat6), and the heavily downloaded free mix La Pistola Mas Rapida&nbsp;(Blentwell.com podcast #7 &amp; CD).<br />Before going digital Filastine founded the Infernal Noise Brigade, a 20-piece marching band formed for the&nbsp;""battle of Seattle"" that went on to become the soundtrack for a decade of globalization protests. The&nbsp;Infernal Noise Brigade was purpose-built to bring music to political movements in the street. Filastine now&nbsp;does the reverse, pumping the immediacy of the street through sound systems.&nbsp;<br />2010 began with a sonic intervention at the Copenhagen Climate Summit, a 12"" of remixes Extra Dirty&nbsp;Bomb, and the new dj mix We Are Experiencing Turbulence. Expect to find him anywhere, shredding the&nbsp;instruction manual of music, crashing borders, and transforming friction into beauty.""<iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F14929&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><a href=""http://www.filastine.com/"">http://www.filastine.com</a> <br /><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/pages/Filastine/168810016505071"">https://www.facebook.com/pages/Filastine/168810016505071</a> <br /><br />General Motor<br />""""""General Motor is a beat fanatic.

Bujak's newest full-length release on Harmonized Records, ""Alive Like the Spine"" tests and pushes the walls of what's being done in the electronica community and crosses into classical, progressive rock and jazz territories to create something truly fresh, smart and original.<br /><a href=""http://www.jeffbujak.com/"">http://www.jeffbujak.com/</a></p>

<p>Parisian Synth Magician d&Eacute;bruit joins the Civil Music stable along side Reso, Rusko, Kotchy, Drums of Death and Starkey.<br /><br />d&Eacute;bruit has pedigree. 2 sensational EPs Coupe D&eacute;cale and most recently Cle De Bras on his and his hommies Parisian label Musique Large.<br />[ Musique Large is d&Eacute;bruit, Fulgeance (One Handed Music), Rekick &amp; Ghilsian Poirier (Ninja Tune) ]<br />When Boomkat made the sell-out Cle De Bras their Record of the week they described his sound as a &ldquo;no holds barred assault through dark Congolese sound systems, downtown L.A. block parties gone wrong, haze filled Kingston recording studios and freaky Tunisian backstreet souks; all powered by a fat hip hop engine&hellip;. the heaviest wonky fusions we&rsquo;ve heard this year&rdquo;<br /><br />Clark, DE:Bug and most of the French press had him pegged as one to watch and XLR8R picked 2 of his tracks in their top 50 of 2008, and recently noted he was their their most downloaded artist with 4 out of the top 10 tracks featuring his trademark synths. d&Eacute;bruit pushes the boundaries with new technique and analogue vibes causing West Coast originator Kutmah to enquire &ldquo; how&rsquo;d you get yours shit so clean and loud&rdquo;<br /><br />In a Congolese basement bar down a Paris side-street is where you&rsquo;ll normally find d&Eacute;bruit dropping beats but after his trip to Red Bull&rsquo;s academy in Barcelona last summer he&rsquo;s been on the body poppin&rsquo; all over Europe and the UK. Along with Hip-House alter ego KeeCLAC he&rsquo;s been remixing Architeq, Kotchy, Meanest Man Contest and Fischerspooner.<br /><br />With excitement building for the Let&rsquo;s Post Funk Release (which has been a highly guarded secret until now) and with Daedelus&rsquo; firm seal of approval stamped on March 09&rsquo;s Low flying sell-out Cle De Bras, this summer is looking heavyweight for d&Eacute;bruit (Real name Xavier Thomas). Parties with Joker, Mike Slott, Jackson, Nake Fake, Robert Hood, Buliion, Paul White and Floating Points in the UK, a crazy set of European dates including the main stage at Sonar and culminating in a final hoorah opening for Afrika Bambaataa at home in Paris&rsquo; Infamous Social Club. And before the summer&rsquo;s out he&rsquo;ll also have swum the channel leaving Paris behind to set up camp in to concentrate on his as yet untitled album due early 2010 on Civil Music.<br /><br />As a first taste of that album Let&rsquo;s Post Funk is undoubtedly pretty special. d&Eacute;bruit&rsquo;s heavy wonky synth lead madness funks out on the West Coast with guest vocals from Om&rsquo;Mas Keith, Jamie Woon, Cerebral Vortex and Buddy Leezle (AKA 215TFK) &amp; Stray. d&Eacute;bruit just keeps getting better, and On Lets Post Funk he&rsquo;s stepped up his production yet again and showcases his freewheelin synthlines, looping and wobbling perfectly. Angular beats chop and wild bass and west coast vibes spill everywhere. d&Eacute;bruits sound is unmistakabley French but combined with LA 80&rsquo;s B-Boy<br /><br /><a href=""http://music.debruit.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://music.debruit.com/</a> <br /> <a href=""http://www.myspace.com/dbruit"" target=""_blank"">http://www.myspace.com/dbruit</a></p>","\N","2010-02-25 13:33:49+00","2010-03-08 20:19:31+00","1","2010-02-07 00:28:16+00","t","f","328393026637"

Since the release of his debut, Prima Materia (Waveform Records) in 2003, Evan has carved a soulful sonic path moving between dub, downtempo, ambient, glitch and psychedelic music. While much of his recorded music can be perceived as reflective or meditative, rest assured, Evan also knows how to command a dancefloor, as he proved at his last appearance in Boston back in December. In 2009, Evan released the excellent and more upbeat &ldquo;The Divine Invasion&rdquo;, as well as the &ldquo;Honey in The Heart EP&rdquo; and &ldquo;Call Of The Wild EP&rdquo;, which he has provided as a free release on his website:<br /><a href=""http://www.bluetechonline.com/"" target=""_blank"">http://www.bluetechonline.com</a><br />With donation you also receive full quality artwork and lossless FLAC audiofiles.<br /><a href=""http://www.myspace.com/iambluetech"" target=""_blank"">http://www.myspace.com/iambluetech</a><br /><br />Supporting act Bakir and Sirios (Spit Bros., Dubs Alive, SF)<br />Bakir is a dubstep/sublow producer and performer based in San Francisco since arriving from Boston in 2004.

<p><br />The Cyborg Trio</p>
<p>The innovative Cyborg Trio are known for their dynamic, psychedelic improvisation and carefully crafted beats. Eric, Sammy and Tim released their fully improvised ""jam"" album in early 2009 and since then have been getting more exposure in both the local and national scenes. Their tight, trance-inducing tunes are reminiscent of a DJ; you'll have to keep reminding yourself that these guys are playing live instruments. They bring the crowd through a journey, offering ups and very relieving downs as the beat drops and groove waves travel through the room, filling the venue with good vibes. Self-produced and live, the new CD gives you a taste of what their live show will entail. Buy their CD ""Broken Beats, Vol. 1&Prime; on iTunes or Amazon and listen to the depth and detail produced from live improvisational jams by The Cyborg Trio.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long time bass music royalty, KING started his musical career as a DJ. Cutting his teeth in the Las Vegas Rave and Drum &amp; Bass scene starting back in &lsquo;97. Pushing forward since with multiple acclaimed mixtapes and CD&rsquo;s. Since then, he has finely tuned his ear and moved on to producing &amp; DJ&rsquo;ing other tempos, including dubstep, glitch, tropical inspired four-four bass music, all the way up to 160BPM footwork &amp; juke. One not to be held down with constraints of time signature or tempo, blending influences of Garage, House, Dubstep, Soul, Funk and Tropical, into smooth, extremely bass-heavy music.</p>
<p>With releases on Play Me, 119, Shift, Betamorph, and Tuff Love Dubs, KING has steadily worked his way to the top! With recent weekly airplay on BBC Radio 1xtra with high acclaim from Mista Jam&rsquo;s Daily Dose of Dubstep.</p>
<p>KING&rsquo;s future projects look just exciting as his past, with forthcoming releases on Starkey&rsquo;s Seclusiasis Imprint, his &ldquo;Bad Dudes&rdquo; collaboration with Air Stegosaurus, and a slew collaborations with countless vocalists and musicians.</p>

<p><strong>Split Phase</strong><br /> Split Phase is a live electronic duo consisting of Carl 'transient' Martin on keys and live electronics with Mike McIntosh on acoustic/electric drums and samples. Split Phase has been hard at work creating and developing a unique, energetic, and refreshing sound all their own. Experimenting with influences ranging from house to drum and bass and jazz to funk, they tap an eclectic mix of styles to weave their sonic tapestries.<br /> <br /> Carl's vast music experience spans the last 2 decades, stemming from his solo project 'transient'. He has released music for many labels throughout the world, and is best known for a wide range of eclectic releases put out by various entities within the netlabel community. His discography which includes over 50 records, 500+ tracks, and spans more than 40 hours, has received millions of downloads and streams.<br /> <br /> Over the past 5 years Mike has established himself as a rhythmical genius with his sticks. Honing in on his style and learning new skills along the way while constantly challenging himself with odd timings and beats on every track.<br /> <br /> From the beginning Split Phase has been a constantly evolving force adapting a do it yourself mentality in and out of the studio, from music production, recording and mastering all of the tracks in house. This combined with the live lighting and visual projections by Nate VanSlyke make for a must see live music experience.<br /> <br /> Mike and Carl's previous accomplishments include playing the 15th Annual New York State Harvest Festival, Camp Bisco 8 &amp; 9, the Utica Music and Arts festival, along with many other venues throughout the NorthEast.<br /> <a href=""http://www.splitphase.com/"" rel=""nofollow nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.splitphase.com/</a><br /> <a href=""http://soundcloud.com/splitphase"" rel=""nofollow nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://soundcloud.com/splitphase</a><br /> <br /><strong> Mad Mauritian</strong><br /> Solo project of <em>Chris Narainen</em> from <em>Blue Boy Productions</em>.<br /> <br /> Visuals by <strong>VJ Shmeejay</strong><br /> <br /> 10 PM, $5, 21+<br /> <br /> 186 Harvard Avenue in Allston<br /> ""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green line B<br /> <br /> For this and future events please visit <a href=""http://www.musicecologyboston.com/"" rel=""nofollow nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.musicecologyboston.com/</a> <br /> or find us on Facebook at <a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology</a><br /> <br /> Promotional assistance by:<br /><strong> LostinSound</strong> <a href=""http://www.lostinsound.org/"" rel=""nofollow nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.lostinsound.org/</a> <br /> and <strong>Forbidden Bass Crew</strong> <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/forbiddenbass"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/forbiddenbass</a></p>","\N","2011-11-26 07:05:29.942078+00","2011-11-26 07:16:51.225075+00","1","2011-11-26 00:33:07+00","t","f","199533273462280"

<p>Music Ecology brings you the return of</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Outlet</strong></p>
<p>Jonathan Belfontaine, otherwise known as Outlet, was destined to make music from the very beginning. At a young age, Jon was given a guitar. Soon afterward, he stumbled upon a broken amp, took it apart and put it back together into working condition. Having an incredible ear for music, he was able to pick out notes, and play along with any song. Over the years, he's played in different rock bands, but his musical interest never stopped at just the guitar, always picking up a bass or a set of drumsticks. While being influenced in different genres of rock, he also became deeply integrated into the electronic scene. Soon he had a keyboard and was experimenting with making music all his own, with psychedelic melodies and hypnotic tones, empowered with heavy instrumentals. After a brief hiatus, his burning passion was reignited when he and his soul mate Elisabeth Marcoux went to Rothbury's music festival in Michigan. Hearing the mind blowing artists perform with such love and high energy, and being immersed in the unified and uplifted crowd, sparked Jon's need to make music again. They immediately went out and bought him a Juno G. The new keyboard, paired with his discovery of Ableton Live, allowed him to explode into creativity again, this time integrating the sounds of hip hop, soul, funk and trance. He has now been producing a dance oriented, groove inspired, glitchy style of music that is energetic, passionate and fun. Of course, infusing his positive vibrations and inspiring light, baked into every morsel of each tantalizing song. The concoction of organic sounds whipped and blended with original bass lines and drum patterns, along with his ability to manipulate the texture and flavor of each synthesized note will leave the listener delighted in savoring every delicious layer baked into every song!</p>

<p>Elevated Arts &amp; Entertainment* and Music Ecology present:<br /><br /><strong>GOVINDA</strong><br /><br />Govinda is the alter-ego of Austin based producer/composer Shane Madden. He began studying violin and composition at the age of eight and went on to study classical violin at the University of Texas where he fell in love with electronic music production. It was in Madden's pursuit of his gypsy roots that he opened his ears to music from around the world. From experiences learning violin with mysterious masters on his journeys across the globe and his passion for modern design and technology, the current sound of Govinda was born.<br />Govinda has played with Thievery Corporation, Tipper, Bassnectar, Shpongle, Cheb I Sabbah, STS9 and many more and been featured on over 25 compilations such as Buddha Bar II, Asian Travels II, and Nirvana Lounge selling a combined 400,000 copies.

For David Krantz, former producer of Agobi Project and 22 year old musician based out of Asheville, NC it is the logical evolution of a lifelong musical obsession. <br /><br />Combining the rhythmic appeal of dubstep and hip hop with melodic dreamscapes and creative sound design, Futexture skillfully weaves a futuristic blend of glitchy bass-heavy IDM and jazzy techstep into a forward thinking sound that defies classification. This unique sonic synthesis is equally suited for both headphones and the dancefloor, and many have described it as a breath of fresh air in electronic music today.<br /><br />A new project as of late 2010, Futexture has been well received in a variety of musical circles. In the first six months of 2011 he has shared the stage with Tipper, Bassnectar, Kilowatts, Nasty Nasty, Bonobo, Ana Sia, Big Gigantic, Heyoka, Falty DL, Bird of Prey, Mimosa, Mindelixir, and Mount Kimbie, and Vibesquad. <br /><br />""Futexture's music is like being in a turkish bath on LSD""<br />-Don Winsley<br /><br />----{Alchemically infused offerings of time breathe love through digital manipulation of finely tuned oscillation<br /><br />Channeling the transmutation of (trans)personal experience into intentional musical exploration}----<br /><br />Can you feel it?<br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F414583&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><br /><br />M.O.O.N.</strong></p>

<p><br /><strong>SPACE JESUS</strong></p>
<p><strong></strong><br />Philly based EDM producer Jasha Tull has created an ever expanding and mind melting experience as Space Jesus. Exploring a multitude of EDM stylings and effectively branding each track with his own bass fueled, psychedelic, Hip-Hop flavor, Space Jesus delivers music that is undeniably fresh and consistently captivating. Jasha began producing music at age 16 with an initial focus on Hip-Hop, that eventually led to his fascination with the production of future-bass music. In 2011, Jasha released SPACE JESUS EP, which immediately brought him an incredible amount of followers throughout the East Coast. Quickly gaining recognition for his individuality, creativity, and high-energy live show, Space Jesus has been popping up all over the states, sharing the stage with incredible acts such as Conspirator, Two Fresh, Minnesota, The Polish Ambassador and Bluetech. Space Jesus has instantly become a mainstay of the electronic music festival scene, with appearances at The Magnetic Gathering and The Big Up in 2011. Hustlin' hard into the new year, Space Jesus shown no signs of slowing down. Keep your eyes peeled, or keep 'em shut, either way you're bound to see Space Jesus tear a wormhole right through the 2012 festival season.</p>

<p><br />Born a bastard lovechild in the Bronx, DASH EXP (Aka Tony Goods) learned from his mother recently that his father (Tony Goodsell) had also been an active DJ in New York City, giving him the goods for a life of musical escapades (and inspiring his recent ""The Goods"" tour). Dash now resides in Seattle (USA) and, since 2005, has established his reputation as a trendsetter in bass culture in the northwest with his funky, NYC-inspired tunes. Introduced to dubstep in 2006 by another local Seattle DJ, Struggle, Dash quickly became a figure in the Seattle dubstep circuit, holding down his own uniquely melodic and experimental take on the genre.&nbsp;<br />Having self-released three successful dubstep mixes (Dub Assassin Series), a 19-track all original mix, and putting out a steady flow of singles, EP's and remixes for notable future-thinking indie labels like Shift. Recordings, Hot N Heavy, Brap Dem, Betamorph and Phantom Hertz, Dash has showed his versatility in genres with tunes ranging from dubstep, jungle, drum and bass, house, garage and UK funky. The eclecticism of his rhythms lends to a frenzy on the dancefloor, and has bought him continued support and play from leading DJ's, producers and labels worldwide, as well as radio play on BBC Radio 1. Poised to make big moves in 2011, he recently added the ""Soundview"" EP on Hot N Heavy Recordings and the ""King of Rock"" EP on Brap Dem Recordings to his catalogue of releases. Look out for the ""Friends"" EP, his debut under the Tony Goods alias, coming out this summer on UK's Sounds of Sumo.&nbsp;<br />http://dashexp.com/http://soundcloud.com/dashexp<br /><br /><strong>RUSS LIQUID</strong><br />Set apart from other up-and-coming West Coast bass music producers by his extensive world-touring history and performance experience, Russ Liquid brings a much-needed injection of melody and emotion to the thriving dance floor community.<br />Classically trained on the piano, trumpet, saxophone and flute, Russ Liquid spent his early 20's touring the Caribbean and South America as part of a jazz quintet, playing resorts, cruise ships and dance clubs. Once the young composer was introduced to electronic music, his course in life was forever altered, and he soon discovered a new home in the international electronic music community.<br />Hand-crafting sexy sounds by blending elements of many genres together, Russ Liquid applies the colorful tones of instrumental music to the realm of the beats with dance floor-rocking results. This talented producer has found an entirely new palette to ""paint"" with, and now he seeks to bridge the gap between classical and modern music with new electronic technology and sonic possibilities.&nbsp;<br />Ample chord changes, foreign sounds and grimy drums on a thick layer of bass give Russ Liquid's music a symphonic quality that hooks the brain with its unique twists and turns. A Portland native who has recently transplanted himself to Oakland, Russ Liquid has found success in the past half-decade performing throughout the United States and Canada with groups such as March Fourth Marching Band and Satori Social (Bluetech's live band). Now this eager artist and performer has stepped out onto his own, bringing a refreshingly melodic approach to the bass music movement.<br />http://russliquid.com/http://soundcloud.com/russliquid</p>

<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.23759487573988736"">Outlet<br />Jonathan Belfontaine, otherwise known as Outlet, was destined to make music from the very beginning. At a young age, Jon was given a guitar. Soon afterward, he stumbled upon a broken amp, took it apart and put it back together into working condition. Having an incredible ear for music, he was able to pick out notes, and play along with any song. Over the years, he's played in different rock bands, but his musical interest never stopped at just the guitar, always picking up a bass or a set of drumsticks. While being influenced in different genres of rock, he also became deeply integrated into the electronic scene. Soon he had a keyboard and was experimenting with making music all his own, with psychedelic melodies and hypnotic tones, empowered with heavy instrumentals. After a brief hiatus, his burning passion was reignited when he and his soul mate Elisabeth Marcoux went to Rothbury's music festival in Michigan. Hearing the mind blowing artists perform with such love and high energy, and being immersed in the unified and uplifted crowd, sparked Jon's need to make music again. They immediately went out and bought him a Juno G. The new keyboard, paired with his discovery of Ableton Live, allowed him to explode into creativity again, this time integrating the sounds of hip hop, soul, funk and trance. He has now been producing a dance oriented, groove inspired, glitchy style of music that is energetic, passionate and fun. Of course, infusing his positive vibrations and inspiring light, baked into every morsel of each tantalizing song. The concoction of organic sounds whipped and blended with original bass lines and drum patterns, along with his ability to manipulate the texture and flavor of each synthesized note will leave the listener delighted in savoring every delicious layer baked into every song! <br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F1165306&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><a href=""http://www.outletmusic.net/"">http://www.outletmusic.net/</a><br /><br />Cyborg Trio<br />The innovative Cyborg Trio are known for their dynamic, psychedelic improvisation and carefully crafted beats. Eric, Sammy and Tim released their fully improvised ""jam"" album in early 2009 and since then have been getting more exposure in both the local and national scenes. Their tight, trance-inducing tunes are reminiscent of a DJ; you'll have to keep reminding yourself that these guys are playing live instruments. They bring the crowd through a journey, offering ups and very relieving downs as the beat drops and groove waves travel through the room, filling the venue with good vibes. Self-produced and live, the new CD gives you a taste of what their live show will entail. Buy their CD ""Broken Beats, Vol. 1&Prime; on iTunes or Amazon and listen to the depth and detail produced from live improvisational jams by The Cyborg Trio. <br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F1075863&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><a href=""http://cyborgtrio.com/"">http://cyborgtrio.com/</a><br /><a href=""https://www.facebook.com/CyborgTrioMusic"">https://www.facebook.com/CyborgTrioMusic</a><br /><br />10 PM, $5, 21+<br /><br /><br />Wonder Bar<br />186 Harvard Avenue in Allston<br />""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green line B<br /><br />Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

Centered around improvisation, they mix grooves such as Dubstep, Funk and Drum'n'Bass freely within the framework of their jazz-influenced compositions. The group is currently a trio consisting of Ezra Platt (Guitar/EFX), Mike Clairmont (Bass/EFX) and Stefan Bildy (Drums). They have already performed at some of New England's premier nightclubs (Middle East Upstairs, Church Boston, Stone Church, Copperfield's, Oliver's, Mill St. Brews).

<p><strong><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.8057636625599116"">Ian Stewart is a Connecticut based producer and performer of alternative electronic dance music. Despite a background in traditional house DJing, Ian has recently made the switch to a live PA style set, allowing him to mix and manipulate his all-original music with much greater flexibility than a two-turntable setup would allow.<br /><br />The catalyst for this transformation was Ian's debut full-length album, Dubonomics, released independently on August 5th, 2011. The music comprising the album was first performed at The Big Up music festival to a wildly enthusiastic reception. Fans lauded the set as ""awesome... one of my favorite acts"", ""stellar"", and ""absolutely perfect"".<br /><br />Since the album's release, Ian has played at several other festivals throughout the north-east, and club dates in New York City, Boston, and New Haven. He has also shared the stage with and supported artists including Tipper, Orchard Lounge, Ott, Pnuma Trio, Eskmo, Sub Swara, Big Gigantic, Elliot Lipp, Telepath, and more.<br /><br />With momentum for Dubonomics still building, Ian has already begun work on his next project. While the future-dub sounds of Dubonomics are perfectly suited to warm up party-goers for a night of full-on electronic bliss, exclusive live performances of the new material already have fans clamoring over the energetic new sound Ian is pursuing.<br /><a href=""http://www.soundcloud.com/ianstewart"">http://www.soundcloud.com/ianstewart</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Louis Deluxe<br /><a href=""http://soundcloud.com/louisdeluxe"">http://soundcloud.com/louisdeluxe</a><br /><br /><br /><br />The Amazing Baz<br /><a href=""http://www.soundcloud.com/theamazingbaz"">www.soundcloud.com/theamazingbaz</a><br /><br /><br /><br />Visuals by VJs Shmeejay and Adrenochrome<br /><br /><br />10 PM, $5, 21+<br /><br />186 Harvard Avenue in Allston<br />""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green line B<br /><br /><br />For this and future events please visit&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.musicecologyboston.com/"">http://www.musicecologyboston.com/</a>&nbsp;<br />or find us on Facebook at&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology"">http://www.facebook.com/MusicEcology</a><br /><br /><br />Promotional assistance by:&nbsp;<br />LostinSound&nbsp;<a href=""http://www.lostinsound.org/"">http://www.lostinsound.org/</a>&nbsp;<br />and Forbidden Bass Crew&nbsp;<a href=""https://www.facebook.com/groups/forbiddenbass"">https://www.facebook.com/groups/forbiddenbass</a></strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>","\N","2012-01-18 18:44:07.719312+00","2012-01-23 23:39:39.190608+00","2","2012-01-12 05:53:33+00","t","t","312258958816774"

<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.519971085479483"">Our friends at Mmmmaven are opening up an EDM production academy right in Central Square. For some reason, DJing equipment is pretty expensive these days. Music Ecology is hosting a fundraiser to help collect a few bucks for this project. This is a great way for everyone to contribute to a great cause! The cover for the night will be our usual $5 but if anyone is feeling generous and wants to donate more, please do so. Your hard-earned dollars will be turned over to Mmmmaven at the end of the night. Read more about the Mmmmaven Project right here.<br /><a href=""http://www.indiegogo.com/mmmmaven"">http://www.indiegogo.com/mmmmaven</a><br /><br />Your musical senses will be entertained by<br /><br />Baltimoroder (Mmmmaven)<br />Baltimoroder was born out of necessity.<br /><br />The story begins in Illinois, where Baltimoroder (aka Erik Pearson) abused cheap Yamaha keytars and Fisher-Price turntables. In high school, punk shows, record stores and raw performance spaces filled his time. On to college, Los Angeles and the mighty KXLU radio station, where he absorbed avant-garde sounds, ambient music and experimental artists.<br /><br />The turning point came after a cross-country trek to Boston and a low-key house party. He took the decks, mixing tracks he had never heard into a swell that kick-started a dance floor. From that night on, the floor never stopped growing. DJing to dance fiends night after night is his passion-whether thugged-out Baltimore music or the retro-sexual glam of Giorgio Moroder. Behold Baltimoroder. New residencies started popping up in all different styles, all the way from Balearic dinner music to Dancehall/Hip-Hop to Techno and Electro. Baltimoroder mixes aggressively and flawlessly in any genre put in his path. It was a chance meeting with David Day; a local promoter and European techno aficionado that took him from the bedrooms to the clubs. Their natural talents were a perfect match; Erik the technical party-rocker and Dave the consummate promoter. In search of greater platform for artists and musicians, they opened the art/event space sQuareOne in the Boston Fort Point district showcasing everything from 2d painting, photography, and film/video to music production, live performance, and some amazing dance parties.<br /><br />But it was the Hearthrob parties that set a new standard. A partnership between Red Fox, Morgan Louis &amp; Greg Fourner (CEO), Hearthrob combines a strong visual aesthetic and peerless experience rounded out with guests such as Johnny Love, Jokers of the Scene, Muscles, Krames, D.I.M, Lifelike, Alan Braxe, Sinden, The Teenagers and many more.<br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F1042106&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><br />David Day (Mmmmaven/Together Boston/Make it New/Basstown Productions/Skywalker Legacy)<br /><br />Fens (Mmmmaven/Banana Peel Records/Together Boston)<br />Fens (M. Rohr) is the co-founder of Banana Peel Records. He produces electronic music and DJ's, and generally enjoys a good low end frequency. He has also been fortunate to have played at Boston venues such as Middlesex Lounge, House of Blues, Goodlife, Enormous Room, Middle East Downstairs, Fenway Park, RISE, among others, as well as having shared the booth with DJs like DJ Assault, Tevo Howard, SBTRKT, Incyde, Tittsworth, Battles, Ghostland Observatory and many more.

He bought some turntables found a warehouse and threw his first parties in late 2000. A brief trip to London in 2001 and a visit to Fabric nightclub provided the catalyst to switch styles from DnB to Breaks. Then in 2006 Pious attended Burning Man where heard Dubstep and Glitch Hop for the first time and instantly knew this was the sound of the future. Today you can hear anyone or all of these styles in a Pious set.<br />Currently Pious holds down residency at Lost In Bass every Monday on glitch.fm as well as at the Tuesday weekly Music Ecology.<br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F64994&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe> <br /><a href=""http://www.mixcloud.com/professorpious"">http://www.mixcloud.com/professorpious</a> <br /><br />Wonder Bar<br />186 Harvard Avenue, Allston<br />""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green Line B<br /><br />10 PM - 2 AM, 21+, $5<br /><br />Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.27522249263711274"">Undrig<br />Undrig is a hot name. Being scrawled upon bathroom<br />mirrors by jet setting wastemen from Timbuktu to Portland Maine.<br />His sets are compromised of deep &amp; thought provoking seamless autosynched blends from the beatport top 100 &amp; youtube transcodes. <br /><br />Purveyor of earthquakes in the foreign lands of Hollis. Selector of a vast array of music that would only work at peak hours. You can find him rocking the 9:00-9:45am time slot, playing electro house for a bunch of sunburned teenagers in k-holes! He also has the unique distinction of being the only dj who wears giant headphones around his neck whilst lurking at parties he never got booked for, yet mixes his entire set with no headphones at all when he finds time out of his busy schedule to accept a booking. <br /><br />The mission statement is to bring crowds to a new level of consciousness through aleatoric compositions featuring complex polymetric rhythms and textures that harken back to the days of musique concrete's prime. This is accomplished by blasting brostep tunes that sound like a poltergeist infested toolshed through a peavey guitar amp (for extra filth) while a castaway from Jersey Shore screams """"ARE YOU READY!?!"""" through a megaphone for the duration of the 45 minute musical journey. <br /><br />Since the beginning of that impossibly humble journey, he has shared the bill with such luminaries as DJ Sparkledink, DJ Muppetfucker and the Kentucky fried blues<br />band!<br /><br />Current artistic endeavors involve a full scale tour of Red Hat Lady conventions &amp; saving up money from parties to have headphones tattooed around his neckline as a tribute to the reassuring voices in his head that keep him soldiering onward. <br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F487885&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe> <br /><br />Nitekrawla<br />""My life is driven to 126 beats per minute. House music is a a way of life.""<br />Born at the end of the disco era in the late 70's NiteKrawla a.k.a. Anthony E was brought up during the birth of house music in the 80's; however, he would not be introduced to this new style of music until his teen years in the early to mid 90's. Once introduced, he realized this new and fresh style of music would put a grip on him that would develop into a passio. Frustrated by the lack of originality in the mainstream and influenced by this new style of music he began djing as an outlet for self expression in his teen years long before ever being able to step foot in a nightclub. He experienced the scene first hand by the end of his teen years and into his 20's and he found himself throwing ""mainstream"" music and its remixes out the window and playing underground grooves exclusively. Now into his early 30's and djing for more than half of his life he still continues to play hard edgy underground grooves that control dance floors. <br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F563403&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><br />Blisk<br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F512313&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><br /><br />10 PM - 2 AM, 21+, $5<br /><br />Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.4857628997415304"">Shigeto<br />Artists take on pseudonyms for a multitude of reasons, but in Zach Saginaw's case, those reasons run deeper than most. Zach records under the name Shigeto. It's his middle name; it's also his grandfather's name, a tribute to the Japanese branch of Zach's family tree. Shigeto also means ""to grow bigger""-appropriate, given Zach's premature birth-weight of less than a pound. Today, Shigeto stands for Zach's vividly beautiful electronic music. Beat-driven but given to richly textured sound design, rhythmically fractured but melodically sumptuous, Shigeto's music is a bridge between the past and present, bringing the artist face to face with a creative legacy that spans decades.<br />Zach was brought up on a steady diet of Michigan-bred music, as his father spoon-fed him old Motown and jazz records by the crateload. Zach picked up the drums at an early age, spending much of his childhood playing in the Detroit/Ann Arbor music scene. After nearly flunking out of high school-save for his music studies-Zach spent three years studying jazz at the New School in NYC and three more in London, where he began woodshedding, obsessed with learning electronic production. Soon enough, beats materialized, Zach moved to Brooklyn and took up the name Shigeto, and Zach's peers began to take notice.<br />Zach's body of work has grown over the last few years to the tune of several EPs on Moodgadget as Shigeto and with A Setting Sun, a pair of EPs under the alias Frank Omura (another family-name reference), and remixes for Worst Friends, Praveen &amp; Benoit, Tycho, Mux Mool, Charles Trees, A Setting Sun, Beautiful Bells, Shlohmo, and more. The Semi-Circle EP and What We Held Onto EP were his first releases with Ghostly International in the spring of 2010. These were followed quickly by the well-received full-length Full Circle and Full Circle Remixes in late 2010 and early 2011 respectively. These releases are nominally indebted to instrumental hip-hop but, like Zach, straddling many worlds at once. Cool shades of ambient music, stuttering early IDM, dubstep sub-bass, and jazz melodicism color Shigeto's palette, which he wields with a painterly attention to detail.<br />Zach continues to be prolific with the upcoming 2012 release, Lineage-a mini-LP of sorts that has a complex constellation of sounds and ideas that we have come to expect from the producer/drummer. However, his compositional focus and restraint grounds songs that are otherwise cosmically inclined. Never has he demonstrated such complete command of his material.<br />Shigeto was one of the first of a wave of young artists who grew up influenced by the label's early output. And again, names come into play. ""Putting out these records on Ghostly isn't just 'getting signed,' for me,"" says Zach, ""it's becoming part of a family, an influence that I've respected forever."" Let's just say the feeling's mutual.<br /><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/CalH4_YQ6dk"" frameborder=""0"" width=""560"" height=""315""></iframe><br /><br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F592907&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><br />foi oi oi &amp; What The Bleep<br />Rooted in a friendship formed in 2004, foi oi oi and What the Bleep are tag team partners hailing from Ohio. ""Ragga jungle"" is the most accurate label used to describe what they play - as they are junglists that lean toward reggae-influenced styles - but they truthfully are not bound by any specific genre. Instead, their focus is on a positive bass music experience with undertones of ragga and dubwise. Their mindfulness of a dancefloor's needs is reflected in their diverse selection of drum &amp; bass, juke, footwork, roots dubstep, dub reggae, dancehall, and more.<br /><br />As their individual musical tastes matured over the years, their duo performance evolved into something much greater than the sum of the parts. Recently they released another iteration of their widely-popular annual mixtape in honor of their Detroit Electronic Music Festival tradition. Each year they attend thefestival, perform at afterparties, and spread their junglist sound as ""brothers"". This year's CD release took on a new greatly-refined form, fluidly transitioning through a surprising multiplicity of sound: ""Feelings for Detroit Vol. 6: Water Sound"". And now, to open the floodgates for new ears to experience a refreshing bass music experience, they are embarking on a CD-release East Coast mini-tour: ""foi oi oi &amp; What the Bleep's Water Sound Voyage"".<br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F191578&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><br /><br />10 PM - 2 AM, 21+, $10<br /><br />Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

His mind ventures through realms he's never viewed inside his mind. His heart races with excitement, and an energy never spoken before. He clenches harder to the empty cassette case. """"The Art of Noise"""", as his father grins paying attention to the street going towards home. Kurtis Hairston was in no way, afraid of the art of noise. Instead he embraced it.

Even as L.E.D.FUT Nick always expressed his versatility through his production showing that he could dabble in just about any genre and do it well. If you know Nick one thing that he has always expressed was that he had a real sweet spot when<br />it came to deep, sexy, bassy music with a hiphop influence.&nbsp;Starting out as a hiphop/Rnb producer this came as no surprise. Bass Glutton is essentially electronic music made for people who love to overindulge in those sensual, soulful, intelligent, in your face bassy beats and grooves.

Bastinado's live shows of all original music are arranged 'on the fly', and continuously mixed like a DJ set featuring Josh Harris on Reactable Live and Joseph B. Carringer on didgeridoo.</span><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">The duo describes their music as inspired by the EDM that they grew up listening to, but with a modern twist. They are fans of musical greats such as The Chemical Brothers, The Crystal</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Method, and The Prodigy to Paul van Dyk, Sasha and Digweed, BT and Orbital. While they view themselves as a band, they are absolutely influenced by the full spectrum of electronic music culture. Mixing guitars and edgy synths with the didgeridoo creates an energy that is on par with a live rock band.</span><br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/bastinadomusic""><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #3b5998; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">http://www.facebook.com/bastinadomusic</span></a><br /><iframe src=""http://www.youtube.com/embed/CgNVMK0Y5G4"" frameborder=""0"" width=""560"" height=""315""></iframe><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Digital Vagabond</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Currently based out of Boston, MA, Digital Vagabond (aka Patrick Boyle) is a highly motivated, mystical and shamanic music and art enthusiast. He is a DJ, photographer, event-planner, manager, and fine-jeweler; a connected individual and man of action who wears many hats within an exponentially growing electronic music and festival culture. His name is essentially derived from his technological nomadic inclinations, embracing digital technology and cyberspace as symbiotic interfaces full of possibility-- the potential for an unlimited network inseparable from nature.</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Patrick Is a synergistic member of Electrogenic, an art collective of creative, inspired, conscious specialists who use their skills and talents to generate positive influence in the world; the collective specifies in modern media, viral marketing campaigns, HD photo, video, and audio processing. &ldquo;Electrogenesis&rdquo; a word used to describe the occurrence of cells connecting electronically in order to heal the body-- powerful intentions and proof that good does exist in the world. Digital Vagabond is also a blog writer for the widely acclaimed online hub LostinSound.org, the go-to site where you can find eloquent writings and resources for the leading music and events in the current underground music scenes.</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Previous activities and collaborations to-date include DJ residencies at Music Ecology and Wobble Wednesday&rsquo;s at Wonderbar (Allston, MA). He is on board as co-organizer and co-manager for Leshpestival annual Music Festival (Milerton, NY), and helped to organize the Brothership Connection Tour featuring lespecial, Spacejesus, and BlueboyProductions. His Dj sets have opened for the likes of Two Fresh, NitGrit, Opiuo, Killowatts, Skytree, BlueBoyProductions, lespecial and more.</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">-Credit to Jackson P.

He bought some turntables found a warehouse and threw his first parties in late 2000. A brief trip to London in 2001 and a visit to Fabric nightclub provided the catalyst to switch styles from DnB to Breaks. Then in 2006 Pious attended Burning Man where heard Dubstep and Glitch Hop for the first time and instantly knew this was the sound of the future. Today you can hear anyone or all of these styles in a Pious set.</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Currently Pious holds down residency at Lost In Bass every Monday on glitch.fm as well as at the Tuesday weekly Music Ecology.""</span><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Fprofessorpious&amp;h=YAQGIEN9N&amp;s=1""><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #3b5998; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">http://soundcloud.com/professorpious</span></a><br /><a href=""http://www.mixcloud.com/professorpious""><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #3b5998; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">http://www.mixcloud.com/professorpious</span></a><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Wonder Bar (Allston)</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Tuesday, October 16th</span><br /><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">10 PM - 2 AM, 21+, $5</span><br /><br /><br /><span style=""font-size: 13px; font-family: Arial; color: #333333; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;"">Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.9912918386980891"">Music Ecology is excited to bring you the Boston debut of Mr. Bill, all the way from Australia!<br />Known for his solo work, Abelton Live tutorials as well as the project Electrocado, this is what Mr. Bill has to say about himself.<br />________________________________________________________________<br />This project is based around evocation, I like to write music that excites the ear and the brain. This requires me to explore all sorts of strange production methods and musical theories to keep exciting my senses.<br />I started writing music in 1996. From 1996 to 2004 I explored all sorts of contemporary music, in 2004 I began using Garageband and exploring electronic music. In 2006 I was introduced to <a href=""http://mrbillstunes.com/media/ableton/"">Ableton</a> Live by a friend and since then I have spent most of my time learning more about it and refining my craft to the point it is at now.<br />People have described the art associated with this project as a distinct brand of 8bit glitchy funk as well as an audiological reflection of our world growing ever more mechanistic which seemingly takes sounds and influences from every aspect of life and a representation of the inner workings of the quantum realm when harvested through concentration and intent.<br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F172873&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><a href=""http://mrbillstunes.com/"">http://mrbillstunes.com/</a> &nbsp;<br /><br />Push/Pull <br />Push/Pull was born in late 2011 and has since begun emitting full-spectrum blasts of audio that will both caress your speaker cones and massage your ears. With focus on large-scale movement and a fine attention to detail, Liam's music is equally suited to a careful listening environment or a large dance floor. This new solo project sees Liam moving in a slightly different direction than his previous partnership with Sheridan Willard as Perileyes.<br />The two did recently collaborate on a remix of Opiuo's ""Robo Booty"" that was released exclusively on addictech and charted for about a month.<br />In the past few years Liam has had the privilege to play sets at Sonic Bloom, The Big Up, The Magnetic Gathering, Equinox, and more, as well as share the stage with acts such as Ott, Kilowatts, Bird of Prey, Excision, Lotus, Benga, Nasty Nasty, Ana Sia, Break Science and more. <br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F6490732&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><br />Heissmusik's TUBE (Liquid Sky)<br />tube was the first moniker of prolific producer/composer Frank Heiss aka fr4nkster. Back in the early 1990's, Inspired by T-Power's remix of DJ Soul Slinger's Abducted, fr4nkster dove headfirst into the Jungle, armed with... an MPC-3000 and an all hardware live PA set up, breaking some serious ground in the US drum-n-bass world at the time. His debut on Liquid Sky Music's Home Entertainment imprint, ALIVE, was immediately compared to likes of Aphex Twin, Squarepusher and Animals on Wheels by CMJ and reviewed in magazines like URB, Mixmag and XLR8R. Nearly 2 decades later, fr4nkster has kept the Mental Step sound of tube ""Still Alive."" More than 20 years after the birth of Liquid Sky's NYC crew, this special performance will contain a smorgasbord of tube music. There will also be a premier of Heissmusik's The Hick Step Massive remix for Gangstagrass and brand new tracks by Heissmusik from the forthcoming album ""Awaken"" - including the live debut of ""Drop The Fuss.""

<p>The Manhattan Project<br />Since exploding on to the scene in 2010, The Manhattan Project has become one of the fastest growing live electronic duos in the northeast. Selling out shows regionally, and with bands like Lotus, Conspirator and BioDiesel, they've gained national attention as a band on the rise. Drawing influences from house, dub, drum n bass, techno and lounge, The Manhattan Project brings sophistication to the dance floor with their original compositions, high energy beats and mind melting textures.&nbsp;Armed with an arsenal of keyboards, synths, electronic and acoustic percussion, they seamlessly merge analogue and digital sounds to create a sonic boomtronic style all their own. Live visuals by NGB and epic light shows bring the concert experience to a new level, and have earned them the reputation of a must-see live band.<br />In just a short time, the duo has toured all over the northeast, playing consistently to large crowds at dance clubs, live music venues and late night festival slots, collaborated with top regional DJ's and MC's, performed live sets on top alternative radio stations and have gained loyal fans through word of mouth and high energy live shows.<br /><br />Their new EP 'Atomic Bomb Party Vol. 2&prime; was just released in April for free download to great reviews and is embraced by DJ and live music fans alike! The Manhattan Project features Shawn Drogan on drums and electronics, and Charlie Lindner on keyboards and synths.<br /><br />The Manhattan Project has opened for Lotus, Conspirator, Future Rock, BioDiesel, Ozric Tentacles, Ludachrist, Communist Party and more.<br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F2606704&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/themanhattanprojectlive"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank"">http://www.facebook.com/themanhattanprojectlive</a><br /><br />BrownNoize<br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F2137288&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><br />Wonder Bar<br />186 Harvard Avenue, Allston<br />""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green Line B<br /><br />10 PM - 2 AM, 21+, $5<br /><br />Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

Mikey began his courtship with music at the age of 13 when he picked up a pair of Technics 1200's and began experimenting with gabber and techno. His skills progressed quickly and soon he was playing raves and warehouse parties with some of the biggest DJ's on the east coast. After entering college, Mikey felt the urge to delve deeper into the creative side of music and began producing with Ableton. His early beats were infused with both Hip-Hop and Electronic rhythms, often blurring the line between the two. He soon discovered that bass was his weapon of choice, and his tracks started to take on more of a dubstep feel. During this time, Mikey was a member of the DJ group The Future Kids with Jasha Tull aka Space Jesus and Bart Tyrpien aka Bartlomein. The dance friendly blends and remixes which made The Future Kids a household name in the central Jersey party scene taught Mikey the methods to hype a crowd. In 2011, these three came together to form the Planet Cognac collective, often collaborating on productions and sharing the stage at shows. These days, Mikey's music can best be described as a bass-fueled deep space adventure sprinkled with hints of glitch-hop, lazerbass, breaks, drum n' bass, and dubstep. His energetic sets have left crowds in a frenzy across the Northeast, playing alongside acts such as Conspirator, Phutureprimitive, Bluetech, KJ Sawka, Wobblesauce, Damn Right, Space Jesus, and many others. One thing that's been proven: if Mikey likes it, your friends will too.<br /><iframe src=""http://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F2545843&amp;show_artwork=true"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><br /><br />Wonder Bar<br />186 Harvard Avenue, Allston<br />""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green Line B<br /><br />10 PM - 2 AM, 21+, $5<br /><br />Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

Now residing in Boston, Spliffolian has continued to rock whatever scene he finds himself in playing alongside his new local crew SUBduction.

<p>Ok kids, here is the deal. On December 25th - Christmas Day (yes, we are not afraid to use the word Christmas in a sentence) we will gather at Wonder Bar like we usually do. We'll start the evening right by watching a wonderful Christmas movie filled with laughter and joy and holiday spirit and that movie just happens to be Die Hard. What can be more festive than the line ""Now I have a machine gun. Ho Ho Ho!""?<br />If we have enough willing people in the joint by midnight, then we can play some musics and do what we generally do on Tuesday nights at Wonder Bar.&nbsp;<br />Join us if your family is too far away to visit during the holidays or if you need an extra-stiff drink after hanging out with them all day. Extra cheers for wearing antlers or elf ears. :)<br />There will be no cover as in FREE so don't sit this one out and try to get there by midnight if you wanna party!<br />Ho Ho Ho!<br /><br />Wonder Bar<br />186 Harvard Avenue, Allston<br />""Harvard Avenue"" stop on Green Line B<br /><br />10 PM - 2 AM, 21+, $ZERO<br /><br />Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.5796973507385701"">HEISS<br />ABOUT:<br />Frank Heiss is a Sonic Sorcerer. Using the medium of audio and practice of Alchemy, he Transmutes Black Magic into Light, representing a Portal through which Psychic Energy may pass while Channeling Divine power from the Kosmos as a Conduit making the reaction possible.<br /><br />BIO:<br />The son of a contemporary classical composer, Frank Heiss started playing drums at the age of four. He became an accomplished orchestral timpanist and drummer, travelling the world while still in his teens with the Youth Philharmonic Orchestra of New England Conservatory.<br />In 1989 he earned the Filene Music Scholarship to attend Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, NY. At Skidmore,he was asked to join the band Conjunction Junction who wrote mostly original songs and performed technically intense covers by bands like King Crimson, The Mahavishnu Orchestra and Rush. Conjunction Junction would go on to record a full length album, Thugnugget in the Skidmore studio and open for Phish in 1990.<br />Exposed to break-beat music in 1991 and inspired by the Ithaca, NY band Jaws, Frank Heiss began to use electronic musical instruments such as the Alternate Mode DrumKAT and the Akai S-950 Sampler. In the Fall of '93, with an already growing interest in Hip-Hop, Frank Heiss heard the sounds of producers like DJ Premier, Pete Rock and Large Professor. He immediately traded in his drums for an Akai MPC-3000 and began to make recordings which would later be released on the label Rising High in the U.K. as Radical Technology. Eventually using exclusively sequenced electronic instruments in the spring of 1995, Heiss moved to New York City where he met Dr. Walker of the electronic duo Air Liquide from Cologne, Germany. After visting Germany in 1996, Heiss spent several years living, recording and performing in Cologne, Boston, and New York City.<br />In 1996 after getting the approval of DJ Soul Slinger, Heiss was given a deal with Liquid Sky Music who released Heiss' album, Alive under the moniker tube in 1997. There were immediate musical comparisons to artists like Aphex Twin, Squarepusher and Photek.Heiss followed up with HearNow Bending Spoons which was released in 1998 on the EMI/Harvest label, which was once home to the music of Soft Machine, Deep Purple and Pink Floyd.<br />The sophomore tube release Steak was completed in 2000. Currently there are six full-length tube releases, all pushing the envelope for ""mental step"" drum-n-bass. At the beginning of the new millennium, while living in New York City, Frank Heiss took a break from performing live but continued to produce and release new music such as his wild Hip-Hop and Country crossover known as The Hick Step Massive. Using this boundless creativity, Heiss began to license music for use in television and advertising working with New York based production library Video Helper as well as music publisher Heavy Hitters.<br />After a hiatus from music and the tour lifestyle, Heiss has reinvented himself as ... himself. No longer using various monikers to introduce his music to the world, Frank Heiss now produces simply as Heiss. An Integral exploration into Spiritual teachings and a renewed outlook on the world around him created a new passion within Heiss to provide music of depth and weight for the Soul. Music with a purpose: to Awaken those who listen. Reflecting his goal, the first album is Awake(n), the title reminding us all of the benefits in remaining conscious and present to the world around us.<br />Frank Heiss currently lives in his home city of Boston and continues to produce and perform, sharing his experience with a 35 year journey into music.<br /><iframe src=""https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Fusers%2F1660340"" frameborder=""no"" scrolling=""no"" width=""100%"" height=""450""></iframe><br /><br />PRISM<br />Prism studied under Vance Gordan [Dicenso's Drum Shop/First Class Band] specializing in Afro Cuban rhythms and the Moeller technique prior to venturing into music production.

With a sound defined by unexpected combinations, this quintet has wowed crowds at clubs, theaters, and festivals across the country. The bands songwriting showcases improvisational interludes and refreshing vocal harmonies with an amplified message of transcendence, unity, and universal understanding. Now hailing from Asheville, NC, Papadosio's mission is clear: to combine eclectic musical traditions with modern electronica to stir the heart and fuel the mind.<br /><br /><br />Consider the Source<br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fconsiderthesourcemusic.com%2F&amp;h=1AQGt1Hz5&amp;s=1"">http://considerthesourcemusic.com/</a><br /><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/CTSmusic"">http://www.facebook.com/CTSmusic</a><br /><br />Three Musicians converging on an epic plateau of sound and reflex. Three conscious minds communicating on sub-conscious levels. New York City's CONSIDER THE SOURCE is the fourth voice, produced when the trio's three distinct personalities combine forces to share their inner music freely with each other.<br /><br />Toting the loaded description Sci-Fi Middle Eastern Funk, their sound is a melting pot of Middle Eastern scales, psychedelic jams, and a hard rocking rhythm section. Featuring Gabriel Marin on Fret-Less Double Neck Guitar, John Ferrara on Bass, and Justin Ahiyon on Drums/Percussion, the three musicians cite their influences as including The Bad Plus, The Mahavishnu Orchestra, King Crimson and Tool-but a major source of their musical power can be attributed to a trip the band took to India, where they studied the complex tala (rhythm) of North India, and the micro-tonal scale structure and melodic ornamentations of South India. Guitarist Gabriel Marin, recently highlighted in Guitar Player Magazine, says, ""Our music combines influences from Turkish, Bulgarian, North and South Indian styles with jazz and fusion, and then we filter it through our own heavy rock and psychedelic sounds and approaches.""<br /><br />Over the past few years this trio has toured the United States numerous times and toured through the Middle East and Europe performing in Israel, Turkey &amp; Germany. Consider the Source has performed alongside such luminaries as Victor Wooten, Wayne Krantz, Kris Myers (of Umphrey's McGee), Wyclef Jean (of The Fugee's), Freak Kitchen, U-Melt at Bowery Ballroom NYC, Klezmer Giant Andy Statman, Grace Potter &amp; The Nocturnals, Garaj Mahal, Jacob Fred Jazz Odyssey, GE Smith (Saturday Night Live Band), Giant Panda Guerilla Dub Squad, The Heavy Pets, Schleigho, The Brew, Kung Fu and many others. They've appeared at numerous festivals including Burning Man, Mid Summer Meltdown, The Big Up, Dogwood Festival (NC), PowWow Festival (MD), NYC Fret-Less Guitar Fest, NYC's Howl Festival, the NY Gypsy Festival and the East Village Arts Festival. Their music has been aired nationally on Fox 5&prime;s Fearless Music TV show, on which they won the award for best unsigned independent act.<br />Consider the Source's new album ""That's What's Up"" is a testament to the band members core beliefs &amp; values about their art and expression. They continue forging new sounds and unique song structures, fusing foreign time signatures with exotic rhythms and refining a dialogue-based form of improvising where the rhythms are the words, the notes are the feelings and the dynamics convey the intensity. The trio has been taking this music around the world, driven by a fearless desire to be themselves and deliver their sound as honestly as they can in the pure rawness of the ""moment"".<br />2012 is already shaping up to be an epic year for the band as their schedule is already filling up with national and international tour dates and festivals. In 2012, Consider the Source goes global! Stay tuned and we'll see you out there...</strong></p>","\N","2013-01-30 21:18:05.231757+00","2013-01-30 21:18:05.231787+00","\N","2013-01-21 09:50:36+00","t","t","456579727712081"

Jeff Bujak is a solo experimental/progressive music producer from Massachusetts who creates instrumental songs centered around classical composition, progressive rock and dance music that dives deep in the waters of complex live electronica. Jen Dulong performs on stage alongside Jeff with an LED hula-hoop providing beautiful lighting and movement with a visual depth to solo musician.

His impressive gigs include legendary parties such as the Boo events in NYC, the Tunnel and Lime Light. Roo, previously known as D.J. Mavrick, has touched on break beats, trance, glitch and even found his own style in dirty electro house keeping the vibe positive and all kinds of dirty. He is no stranger to summer music festivals. He's made appearances at New York Harvest Festival, Camp Bisco, Heads in Harmony and Camp Coldbrook. Keeping with his theme of constant progression, Roo now finds himself somewhere between deep house, tech, and dirty disco.<br /><a href=""http://www.mixcloud.com/roo-nicora/"">http://www.mixcloud.com/roo-nicora/</a><br /><br />10 PM - 2 AM, 21+, $5<br /><br />Music Ecology is a Boston based event production collective formed in the summer of 2009.

<p><strong id=""internal-source-marker_0.4872122521046549"">Timbre Coup:<br />-Timbre [tam-ber]: the characteristic quality of sound produced by a particular instrument or voice; tone color.<br /><br />-Coup [koo]: a sudden successful, unexpected stroke, act or move; a hostile takeover.<br /><br />Formed in 2007, Timbre Coup is a progressive rock band hailing from Albany New York. The band is comprised of Dan Gerken (guitar/bass/vocals), Andrew Chamberlaine (guitar), Ben (guitar/bass) and brother Matt Pickering (drums).<br />In their time together as a band, the members of Timbre Coup have become a cohesive force to be reckoned with. Often compared to groups such as King Crimson and Umphrey's McGee, this prog (or ""improg"") band also has a very danceable side. ""We want people to pay attention to the details and intricacies of our songs, but we love making people dance."" says drummer Matt Pickering. ""Our music was as accepted at Camp Bisco as it was at MoeDown.""<br />Speaking of festivals, this young group has had the opportunity to perform at SnoeDown, MoeDown, Mountain Jam, Catskill Chill, and Camp Bisco, to name a few. Pair that with support slots for The New Deal, Brothers Past, Project/Object, Consider the Source, UMelt, etc. and there's no wonder why these boys have been picking up so much steam on the East Coast. Since April 2012, touring has extended from the most Northeastern regions of the country, down the Savannah GA and everywhere in between. It's only a matter of time before fans all across the US will be able to see Timbre Coup in their hometown.<br />With three full length albums under their belt, the band will return to the studio in early 2013 and plans on releasing a double disc album soon after. But for now, the concept album Knuckles &amp; Valleys is Timbre Coup's most recent release (February 23rd 2012). For a band that is known for both heavy, progressive riffs and spacey grooves, and for being able to both shred hard and create intricate upbeat melodies, Knuckles &amp; Valleys proves to be a mature whirlwind of genres, wonderfully blended into compositions that show a band at a new height of progress and song craft.</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Bass Glutton</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">If you like music from labels like Dirtybird Records, Pets Recordings, Hot Creations etc. then you need to dive into the world of Bass Glutton. Producer/DJ Nick Smeed wanted to take his music back to where he started before the aggressive styles of his more commonly know identity of L.E.D.FUT took over. Even as L.E.D.FUT Nick always expressed his versatility through his production showing that he could dabble in just about any genre and do it well. If you know Nick one thing that he has always expressed was that he had a real sweet spot when it came to deep, sexy, bassy music with a hip hop/rnb influence. Starting out as a hip hop/Rnb producer this came as no surprise. Bass Glutton is essentially electronic music made for people who love to overindulge in those sensual, soulful, intelligent, in your face bassy beats and grooves. Bass Glutton intends to elaborate on the current styles in this realm of electronic music and also pepper in some of the classic styles we have all come to love over the years. His impeccable skill of fusing many styles and adaptability to read and please just about any crowd makes for unforgettable live performances that are something you truly have to experience for yourself.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Jaminic</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Over the past few years, Boston based DJ/Producer Jaminic has been playing under his main project N.E. Tempo. For this young producer, music is a lifestyle, and he is an inspiration to other young artists who have seen him take a dream and run with it. His interest in playing music started in his early teens when, inspired by the radio, he wanted to learn to mix tracks himself. He started his music career spinning records and soon became immersed in more technology like CDJs and midi controllers. Influenced by artists such as Orchard Lounge, Dirty Bird Records, James Zabiela, and Modeselektor, Jaminic's deep bass and melodic house beats create a feel-good Tropical atmosphere, where everyone wants to be. Currently a student, he has taken classes at the New England Institute of Art for Audio Production, such as Audio Technology--where he studied waveforms and frequencies, and Audio Recording, in which he recorded and edited a band in the studio. He is also largely self-taught though countless hours in the studio working on original production.</p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Jaminic started playing at local parties and clubs in Massachusetts including Goodlife, Middlesex, Phoenix Landing, Rise, and Umbria. He soon went on to play to bigger crowds at venues like Santos Party House in New York City, Lupo's and Therapy in Road Island, Curve Ultra Lounge in Maine, and Castaway's in New York State. Jaminic has played with some of the hottest artists including Nasty Nasty, Big Gigantic, Benga, Steve Porter, Zeds Dead, Orchard Lounge, Clockwork, Nightriders, Alex B, Two Fresh, Beats Antique BioDiesel, EOTO, Nit Grit, Sub Swara, Walter Jones and last but certainly not least Chas Bronz. He has affiliations with groups such as The Brain Trust, Mass EDMC, True Crew, and CreateSpace Collab (CSC). Ranging threw all genres of electronica Jaminic's main style of sound is tropical bass, as it has many natural elements of global island vocals and crunchy bass lines. Presently, he has a monthly residency at An Tains in Boston called Bass Oasis, which features many local up-and-coming and headlining artists. He is also involved in the production of a music festival located in central Massachusetts called Camp Coldbrook, held in late June, which features live bands, DJs, a silent disco, and performance groups. Be on the look out for original Jaminic productions to be released spring 2012. You can also expect to see him blowing up festivals &amp; dance floors at venues near you!</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Don Fochi</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr"">Zachary Fochi (Don Fochi) started seeing shows around the 9th grade. First, seeing Incubus and then moving on to the jam band scene. Fueled mainly by the Disco Biscuits, Lotus and several DrumNbass artists he became an avid music junky. Seeking out new and exciting sounds he ventured into the underground dubstep and house party scene. In 2008 he moved to Somerville, MA where he became good friends with Lee Brandenburg. Together they began producing and playing their own dubstep/house tracks at private parties and venues around Boston. Together their production soon progressed out of the wobble, and Zachary was introduced to the underground Deep house scene. After countless NY, Boston and Miami parties he became inspired by producers/DJ's such as Maya Jane Coles, MaceoPlex, Audiofly and M.A.N.D.Y. just to name a few. Now his inspired DJ sets have an emotional and deep groove to them always creating a positive energy and vibe. He can be found at venues and parties along the east-coast, mainly Boston.</p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Bass - Clay Parnell (Brothers Past/Biodiesel/Kick Rocks)</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Drums - Rich Hartranft</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Philly based EDM producer Jasha Tull has created an ever expanding and mind melting experience as Space Jesus. Exploring a multitude of EDM stylings and effectively branding each track with his own bass fueled, psychedelic, Hip-Hop flavor, Space Jesus delivers music that is undeniably fresh and consistently captivating. Jasha began producing music at age 16 with an initial focus on Hip-Hop, that eventually led to his fascination with the production of future-bass music. In 2011, Jasha released SPACE JESUS EP, which immediately brought him an incredible amount of followers throughout the East Coast. But it wasn't until the release of 'PLANiTS' on Mal Label Music, that his popularity spread from one coast to the other. The 'PLANiTS' release charted into the top 5 on multiple Beatport lists, and landed as an exclusive track on the website for weeks.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Quickly gaining recognition for his individuality, creativity, and high-energy live show, Space Jesus has been popping up all over the states, sharing the stage with acts such as Big Gigantic, Zeds Dead, Conspirator, Two Fresh, Break Science, Adventure Club, Freddy Todd, Kraddy (of the Glitch Mob), Minnesota, The Polish Ambassador, Sugarpill, Mr. Bill and Bluetech. Space Jesus has instantly become a mainstay of the electronic music festival scene, with appearances at Lights All Night, Camp Bisco, Big Up, Rootwire, Uphoria Festival, The Magnetic Gathering and even the Dubstep Music Awards. Hustlin' hard into the new year, Space Jesus shows no signs of slowing down. Keep your eyes peeled, or keep 'em shut, either way you're bound to see Space Jesus tear a wormhole right through the ever evolving EDM scene.</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Greenhouse Lounge</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Greenhouse Lounge is an electronic musical trio that combines the computer based production of a DJ, accompanied by rock guitar leads, heavy synthesized bass and live drums. They are adept at merging these rumbling dub basslines with pumping electronica beats, breakbeat dynamics and staggering sample manipulation. Their music can be described as euphoric; a hypnotic based sound; tightly woven sonic soundscapes that are rich in melody and texture.</strong></p>

Please be safe and take care of your loved ones.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>WALA</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Hailing from the bass factory of San Francisco, WALA blends a sexy, worldly quality into the scintillating sounds of Glitch-Hop and Dubstep. &nbsp;She takes dancefloors on a kinetic journey from massive crunk to cultured bhangra--and every planetary highway in-between--while staying true to bass culture's grimy foundations. This has propelled the tiny purple haired producer to esteemed status and has sent her to festivals and clubs all over the country.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>After colliding with Bass Music amidst the dusts of Burning Man in 2005, WALA immersed &nbsp;herself in the edm and festival culture of the West Coast, and in 2010, after a little push from her now close friend and mentor, ill.Gates, she left her career as an anthropologist to follow her musical roots. Fueled by a passion to encourage others to engage with music on an emotional level and possessing a musical background dating back to when she was just six years old, WALA quickly established a following in the West and beyond. With a heavily stamped passport and an arsenal of seven spoken languages, she has developed an eclectic musical style infused with Indian percussion, heavy bass, and glitched middle-eastern samples.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>WALA's first EP, KaliKutta, was highly acclaimed with an anxiously anticipated second release, Smoke Sutra, due to be released in mid April. She has shared the stage with the likes of Minnesota, Freq Nasty, ill.Gates, GRiZ, Grammatik, Marty Party and more. &nbsp;She has performed at events and festivals such as Electronic Forest, Burning Man (setting a personal record of 17 sets in five days in 2012), Lucidity Festival, and many others across the globe, with a lot of exciting plans for the future.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>WALA is currently touring, creating new music, and offering workshops in Ableton Live 9. &nbsp;Her cat, Harley, likes to sing along to her music when she's home producing. &nbsp;Harley isn't a good singer. &nbsp;He's also a little irked that WALA is on the road so much, but he's a cat...so he'll get over it. &nbsp;For more, visit</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>DJ Reverence</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>A new school kid with an old school heart; DJ Reverence has had an affinity for house music ever since first hearing Nightcrawlers' ""Push The Feeling On"" as a kid. Never having been able to afford DJ gear; Reverence put the idea of DJing in the back of his head until the summer of 2010 when he bought his first controller. Without taking a second look back, it was on! His style of music has evolved steadily year after year, and it now exactly where it needs to be. On any given night in any state in New England you can find him mixing up the latest in cutting edge dance music; ranging from jackin' House to Disco bangers, and now the incredible sounds of the Future Bass and Future Garage movements.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>The goal is simple.</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>To bring you the latest in dance music while also educating the younger generations on the backbone of where all this wonderful music came from. Old and new collide whenever he gets on the decks, making every single set a unique journey through the land of House Music. Being a part of the Live Free And Dance crew exemplifies this quality as they bring together class A acts, from the old and the new; creating unforgettable moments on the dance floor for everyone in attendance!</strong></p>

<p><strong>DJ Zoses</strong><br /><strong>My interest in electronic music started when I first heard trance. Trance's progression and ability to evoke strong emotions inspired me to find more conscious altering tracks. Now, I have moved away from the trance scene into the ever evolving scenes of bass music. Whether it's dub, garage, D&amp;B, deep house or glitch hop - all that matters to me is making people dance.</strong><br /><strong>Through house parties, the festival scene and a booming music/bar scene in Boston I have been able to make my dreams a reality.</strong><br /><strong>As&nbsp;a DJ, I focus on creating a musical journey through various genres of bass music, keeping the crowd on its toes. Each set is unique and tailor fitted to the night/venue. I treat DJ'ing as an art and only spin tracks that I love.</strong><br /><strong><a href=""http://www.soundcloud.com/zoses"" rel=""nofollow nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.soundcloud.com/zoses</a>&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong><a href=""http://www.fb.com/dj-zoses"" rel=""nofollow nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.fb.com/dj-zoses</a>&nbsp;</strong><br /><strong><a href=""http://www.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Fdj-zoses&amp;h=TAQFtqwlP&amp;s=1"" rel=""nofollow nofollow"" target=""_blank"">www.mixcloud.com/dj-zoses</a>&nbsp;</strong><br /><br /><strong>calllmebruce </strong><br /><strong>callmebruce is the producer alias of 22-year old, multi-genre, multi-instrumentalist Kevin Walsh.

<p><strong>Joseph Nicora aka Roo born in 1978, exploded his unique style of deep progressive house into the east coast rave scene back in '97. His impressive gigs include legendary parties such as the Boo events in NYC, the Tunnel and Lime Light. Roo, previously known as D.J. Mavrick, has touched on break beats, trance, glitch and even found his own style in dirty electro house keeping the vibe positive and all kinds of dirty. He is no stranger to summer music festivals. He's made appearances at New York Harvest Festival, Camp Bisco, Heads in Harmony and Camp Coldbrook. Keeping with his theme of constant progression, Roo now finds himself somewhere between deep house, tech, and dirty disco.</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>eelko is the moniker for Boston based DJ and producer, Christopher Carchedi, who is living proof that electronic music production has allowed composers to find a sound and voice all their own, as his music is unparalleled in its uniqueness. While there is still common ground and tradition out there, it's safe to say that now more than ever, no two producers will sound alike, and eelko is one of the most developed and mature examples of this new phase in the evolution of music.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>All his instrumental selections sit in the frequency spectrum unobtrusively. This is proof that his years of audio engineering work have manifested well. eelko's music is spacious and airy, using silence as efficiently as sound to create the interlock necessary for an emotionally moving dance track.</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>lespecial (The Brain Trust)</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Born in the woods of Connecticut and raised in the wilds of Boston, lespecial has established themselves as innovators and tastemakers on their own unique trajectory. The aggressive death-funk dance trio explodes with energetic live sets, tapping into a primitive past distorted through the lense of contemporary technology. Coming off the release of their second EP, Ceremony, preceded by Playonbrother Sessions (2011), Jonathan Grusauskas (guitar/keys/trumpet), Luke Bemand (bass guitar/synth) and Rory Dolan (drums/samples) ignore convention, instead amalgamating the familiar styles of Afro-Latin &nbsp;traditions, Hip Hop, Funk and Metal into a singular sound that dexterously transforms during their live sets and over the course of their studio albums. As Ben Weiss of Relix Magazine puts it, ""Amidst the rest of the noise, lespecial is the squeaky wheel that demands attention.""</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Supersillyus (The Brain Trust, Re:Evolution)</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Supersillyus is an electronic musician and producer based in Allston, MA. His music is a genre-bending adventure through psychedelic IDM and dub and he has recently shared the stage with acts like Hallucinogen, Ott, Conspirator, Eoto, Phutureprimative, and Tipper. His first full length release, Grampaspaceshuttle, tickled the ears of the electronic community, earning him a spot on LostinSound.org's Top 5 Newcomer Albums of 2010.</strong></p>
<p><strong><br /></strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>He spent over a year meticulously crafting his second record Tesselations, which was released through Base Trip Records. With this epic double album, Supersillyus allows listeners to explore highly evolved and extensively layered soundscapes, while shaking their asses to a tasty mix of tribal drums, swirling synths, and the occasional marimba solo.Tesselations takes the listener on a journey past boundaries of IDM, world beat, and dub, making use of traditions as old as Sanskrit chants or a child's Saxaboom.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Russ Liquid</strong><br /><strong>Russ Liquid is the future-vintage groove-blasting maestro who has stirred the souls and minds of the electronic music world. Renowned for his ingenious compositional approach, this cosmic virtuoso and imprints a prophetic musical experience on his audiences. He detonates explosive beatscapes, seamlessly adding flourishes of instrumental color and emotion; all while drawing from an endlessly diverse sonic palette.</strong><br /><strong>In only a short time, Mr. Liquid has developed a reputation for radiating a sonic supernova of genre-bending beats on the dancefloor, captivating audiences with passionate live instrumental performances across the U.S. and beyond. In 2012, the member of the Headtron crew's dynamic, multi-instrumental, experience was unleashed on some of the most innovative events and festivals around the globe including: Coachella, Symbiosis Gathering, Lightning In A Bottle, Shambhala, Sonic Bloom, Envision Festival (Costa Rica), and Eclipse Festival (Australia).</strong><br /><strong>In February of 2013, Russ resumes his destiny to break musical boundaries and transcend expectations with Foreign Frequency, his debut full length album on STS9's 1320 Records. Foreign Frequency transports listeners on an inter- dimensional adventure to the deepest circles of his musical universe, steering audiences into an expansive world of visceral beats, laced with spiraling instrumental accompaniments, and adorned with melodies that only a masterful improvisationalist could manifest.</strong><br /><strong>As the new year begins, Russ Liquid is plotting new schemes to lead people deeper into his sonic landscapes across the globe, beginning by supporting STS9 on their 2013 Winter Tour.</strong></p>

<p dir=""ltr""><strong>""Dopapod isn't so much a jam band as they are a band that improvises. They are an electronic band without computers. They are a metal band with groove and soul. They are a jazz group with less wine and more acid. They are what would happen if Zappa, Yes, Deadmau5, and The Meters all sat down for a cup of coffee.""</strong></p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>-RVA mag</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>With no regard towards towards stylistic boundaries, the sound that emerges from Dopapod both live and in the studio is as varied and diverse as the many influences that they adapt from. Their approach and commitment to complementing a distinct genre bending sound to top-notch musicianship has set them apart from many of their contemporaries and keeps music lovers eagerly returning to shows.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Dopapod has been touring nationally playing 150+ shows a year for the last three years. Their rigorous tour schedule has seen the young, yet seasoned group make appearances at numerous festivals including Rootwire, Gathering of the Vibes, Bonnaroo, Mountain Jam, Burning Man, Bear Creek, The Big Up, Camp Bisco, and more. Their electric live showcase has been cultivating a fast growing and loyal fan base.</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p dir=""ltr""><strong>Their third studio effort 'Redivider' was release on December 21st 2012. Having been recorded and released less than a year after the band's last record Drawn Onward came out, recording was done at Tyrone Farm, a scenic and completely solar powered farm in the small town of Pomfret, CT. Opting to take a different route than recording in a studio, the band brought their own to the barn of the farm and produced it by themselves. Redivider displays a drastic evolution in the band's songwriting skills as well as marking the first time ever that the band has added vocals into songs. The added texture serves as yet another dimension in what allows the band to look in multiple directions at one time while remaining focused on a cohesive blend of sound.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Akara</strong><br /><strong>Akara is a symphony for the post-digital age. Elegant classical composition combined with detailed psychedelic production; mystical, devotional vocals with lyrics beyond language combined with deep synth bass. Akara's music is a genre entirely its own. Independent of dance music trends without being unaware of them, Akara combines fragments of Baroque and Medieval music, twentieth-century minimalist music, Indian classical, and gamelan, with psydub, glitch-hop, dubstep, and downtempo grooves.</strong><br /><strong>Fully&nbsp;composed for and recorded with a small classical orchestra of top-notch players, and featuring the ethereal vocals of Femke Weidema, Akara's sound is a high-quality, cinematic, intelligent musical journey through consciousness.</strong><br /><strong>Akara is created and curated by Joshua Penman, an award-winning composer with performances in Carnegie Hall, by seventeen full orchestras, and by choruses, bands, and chamber ensembles around the world. Joshua has also scored five films, holds a doctorate in classical composition, played in Balinese and Sundanese gamelans, and studied ragas in India with master vocalist Devashish Dey.</strong><br /><strong>The name Akara comes from the Indonesian words for ""root or vine"" and ""ritual or performance"" and the energy of the project is inspired by the trance rituals of Bali, the shamanic ceremonies of the Amazon, and the new visionary art and culture of Burning Man and the West Coast festival scene.</strong><br /><strong>Akara performs in many incarnations - as a seven-piece live ensemble with dance performers all the way down to DJ-sets. Whatever the setting, Akara is a new kind of ritual performance for your mind.</strong><br /><strong>Akara has performed at many of the premiere US visionary festivals, including Symbiosis, Lightning in a Bottle, Sonic Bloom, Rootwire, Burning Man, and more.</strong><br /><br /><strong>""... the cutting edge of electronic composition ... beyond anything I've heard ...

<p><strong>Welcome to our second to last show as part of our almost 5 year running Tuesday night residency at Wonder Bar!</strong><br /><br /><strong>Our guest this evening is Psymbionic!</strong><br /><br /><strong>$5, 21+</strong><br /><br /><strong>Psymbionic</strong></p>

<p><strong>Cresting the modern wave of electronic producers, Psymbionic creates aural experiences that explore the range of multi-tempo Bass Music within an influential and dynamic culture. With an ear for situational relevance, Psymbionic enjoys turning non-traditional sound design and infectious rhythms into dancefloor heat, while also maintaining his history in the downtempo, emotive side of the electronic sound.</strong><br /><br /><strong>In a live show context, Psymbionic confronts mixes that are limited to the scope of the build and release, avoiding an industry epidemic of drop-monotony that overpowers the flow of music. Burcham seeks to prove that there are more powerful influences in moving a crowd than simple tension, providing an interwoven dynamic that relies on the strength of his blend, rather than the sole force or familiarity of the apex.&nbsp;</strong></p>

With a strong background in classical piano and trombone, Jennings is always working on new productions to weave into his sets. Glitch hop is the foundation, and variety is the spice of life. Imagine swing piano, Balkan horns, tribal percussion, and deep bass all mixed up in a cauldron and blasted through a wall of subs.</strong><br /><br /><strong>As a founder and key organizer of the arts collective known as the Party Liberation Front, Mr Jennings brings the PLF's good vibrations to venues and festivals up and down the East Coast. He has co-produced many successful events in Virginia and beyond, such as Lazer Crunk and the classic swinging Speakeasy parties. In addition to playing events, Mr Jennings hosts the Crunkfederacy, a bi-weekly radio show on Glitch.FM from 1-3am EST every 2nd and 4th Thursday of the month.&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Hey everyone,<br />We have some pretty exciting news to share with you today. Just because we aren't producing shows every week, does not mean we have gotten fat and lazy and stopped working on ""musics"". We are starting a monthly mostly humorous publication / newsletter / blog filled with all sorts of fun stuff. People signed up for our email list will get the content in bulk and the rest we'll post on social media throughout the month. Sign up for the newsletter now and be the first to pass judgement on our new project!!! First issue (fingers crossed!) comes out on Monday.
